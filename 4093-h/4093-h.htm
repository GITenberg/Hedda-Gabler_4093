      INTRODUCTION <br /> by William Archer
    </h2>
    <p>
      From Munich, on June 29, 1890, Ibsen wrote to the Swedish poet, Count Carl
      Soilsky: "Our intention has all along been to spend the summer in the
      Tyrol again. But circumstances are against our doing so. I am at present
      engaged upon a new dramatic work, which for several reasons has made very
      slow progress, and I do not leave Munich until I can take with me the
      completed first draft. There is little or no prospect of my being able to
      complete it in July." Ibsen did not leave Munich at all that season. On
      October 30 he wrote: "At present I am utterly engrossed in a new play. Not
      one leisure hour have I had for several months." Three weeks later
      (November 20) he wrote to his French translator, Count Prozor: "My new
      play is finished; the manuscript went off to Copenhagen the day before
      yesterday.... It produces a curious feeling of emptiness to be thus
      suddenly separated from a work which has occupied one's time and thoughts
      for several months, to the exclusion of all else. But it is a good thing,
      too, to have done with it. The constant intercourse with the fictitious
      personages was beginning to make me quite nervous." To the same
      correspondent he wrote on December 4: "The title of the play is <i>Hedda
      Gabler</i>. My intention in giving it this name was to indicate that
      Hedda, as a personality, is to be regarded rather as her father's daughter
      than as her husband's wife. It was not my desire to deal in this play with
      so-called problems. What I principally wanted to do was to depict human
      beings, human emotions, and human destinies, upon a groundwork of certain
      of the social conditions and principles of the present day."
    </p>
    <p>
      So far we read the history of the play in the official "Correspondence."<a
      name="H1" id="H1"></a>(<a href="#linka">A</a>) Some interesting
      glimpses into the poet's moods during the period between the completion of
      <i>The Lady from the Sea</i> and the publication of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>
      are to be found in the series of letters to Fraulein Emilie Bardach, of
      Vienna, published by Dr. George Brandes.<a name="H2" id="H2"></a>(<a
      href="#linkb">B</a>) This young lady Ibsen met at Gossensass in the Tyrol
      in the autumn of 1889. The record of their brief friendship belongs to the
      history of <i>The Master Builder</i> rather than to that of <i>Hedda
      Gabler</i>, but the allusions to his work in his letters to her during the
      winter of 1889 demand some examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      So early as October 7, 1889, he writes to her: "A new poem begins to dawn
      in me. I will execute it this winter, and try to transfer to it the bright
      atmosphere of the summer. But I feel that it will end in sadness&mdash;such
      is my nature." Was this "dawning" poem <i>Hedda Gabler</i>? Or was it
      rather <i>The Master Builder</i> that was germinating in his mind? Who
      shall say? The latter hypothesis seems the more probable, for it is hard
      to believe that at any stage in the incubation of <i>Hedda Gabler</i> he
      can have conceived it as even beginning in gaiety. A week later, however,
      he appears to have made up his mind that the time had not come for the
      poetic utilisation of his recent experiences. He writes on October 15:
      "Here I sit as usual at my writing-table. Now I would fain work, but am
      unable to. My fancy, indeed, is very active. But it always wanders away
      ours. I cannot repress my summer memories&mdash;nor do I wish to. I live
      through my experience again and again and yet again. To transmute it all
      into a poem, I find, in the meantime, impossible." Clearly, then, he felt
      that his imagination ought to have been engaged on some theme having no
      relation to his summer experiences&mdash;the theme, no doubt, of <i>Hedda
      Gabler</i>. In his next letter, dated October 29, he writes: "Do not be
      troubled because I cannot, in the meantime, create (<i>dichten</i>). In
      reality I am for ever creating, or, at any rate, dreaming of something
      which, when in the fulness of time it ripens, will reveal itself as a
      creation (<i>Dichtung</i>)." On November 19 he says: "I am very busily
      occupied with preparations for my new poem. I sit almost the whole day at
      my writing-table. Go out only in the evening for a little while." The five
      following letters contain no allusion to the play; but on September 18,
      1890, he wrote: "My wife and son are at present at Riva, on the Lake of
      Garda, and will probably remain there until the middle of October, or even
      longer. Thus I am quite alone here, and cannot get away. The new play on
      which I am at present engaged will probably not be ready until November,
      though I sit at my writing-table daily, and almost the whole day long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here ends the history of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, so far as the poet's letters
      carry us. Its hard clear outlines, and perhaps somewhat bleak atmosphere,
      seem to have resulted from a sort of reaction against the sentimental
      "dreamery" begotten of his Gossensass experiences. He sought refuge in the
      chill materialism of Hedda from the ardent transcendentalism of Hilda,
      whom he already heard knocking at the door. He was not yet in the mood to
      deal with her on the plane of poetry.<a name="H3" id="H3"></a>(<a
      href="#linkc">C</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hedda Gabler</i> was published in Copenhagen on December 16, 1890. This
      was the first of Ibsen's plays to be translated from proof-sheets and
      published in England and America almost simultaneously with its first
      appearance in Scandinavia. The earliest theatrical performance took place
      at the Residenz Theater, Munich, on the last day of January 1891, in the
      presence of the poet, Frau Conrad-Ramlo playing the title-part. The
      Lessing Theater, Berlin, followed suit on February 10. Not till February
      25 was the play seen in Copenhagen, with Fru Hennings as Hedda. On the
      following night it was given for the first time in Christiania, the
      Norwegian Hedda being Froken Constance Bruun. It was this production which
      the poet saw when he visited the Christiania Theater for the first time
      after his return to Norway, August 28, 1891. It would take pages to give
      even the baldest list of the productions and revivals of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>
      in Scandinavia and Germany, where it has always ranked among Ibsen's most
      popular works. The admirable production of the play by Miss Elizabeth
      Robins and Miss Marion Lea, at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, April 20,
      1891, may rank as the second great step towards the popularisation of
      Ibsen in England, the first being the Charrington-Achurch production of <i>A
      Doll's House</i> in 1889. Miss Robins afterwards repeated her fine
      performance of Hedda many times, in London, in the English provinces, and
      in New York. The character has also been acted in London by Eleonora Duse,
      and as I write (March, 5, 1907) by Mrs. Patrick Campbell, at the Court
      Theatre. In Australia and America, Hedda has frequently been acted by Miss
      Nance O'Neill and other actresses&mdash;quite recently by a Russian
      actress, Madame Alla Nazimova, who (playing in English) seems to have made
      a notable success both in this part and in Nora. The first French Hedda
      Gabler was Mlle. Marthe Brandes, who played the part at the Vaudeville
      Theatre, Paris, on December 17, 1891, the performance being introduced by
      a lecture by M. Jules Lemaitre. In Holland, in Italy, in Russia, the play
      has been acted times without number. In short (as might easily have been
      foretold) it has rivalled <i>A Doll's House</i> in world-wide popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been suggested,<a name="H4" id="H4"></a>(<a href="#linkd">D</a>)
      I think without sufficient ground, that Ibsen deliberately conceived <i>Hedda
      Gabler</i> as an "international" play, and that the scene is really the
      "west end" of any European city. To me it seems quite clear that Ibsen had
      Christiania in mind, and the Christiania of a somewhat earlier period than
      the 'nineties. The electric cars, telephones, and other conspicuous
      factors in the life of a modern capital are notably absent from the play.
      There is no electric light in Secretary Falk's villa. It is still the
      habit for ladies to return on foot from evening parties, with gallant
      swains escorting them. This "suburbanism," which so distressed the London
      critics of 1891, was characteristic of the Christiania Ibsen himself had
      known in the 'sixties&mdash;the Christiania of <i>Love's Comedy</i>&mdash;rather
      than of the greatly extended and modernised city of the end of the
      century. Moreover Lovborg's allusions to the fiord, and the suggested
      picture of Sheriff Elvsted, his family and his avocations are all
      distinctively Norwegian. The truth seems to be very simple&mdash;the
      environment and the subsidiary personages are all thoroughly national, but
      Hedda herself is an "international" type, a product of civilisation by no
      means peculiar to Norway.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot point to any individual model or models who "sat to" Ibsen for
      the character of Hedda.<a name="H5" id="H5"></a>(<a href="#linke">E</a>)
      The late Grant Allen declared that Hedda was "nothing more nor less than
      the girl we take down to dinner in London nineteen times out of twenty";
      in which case Ibsen must have suffered from a superfluidity of models,
      rather than from any difficulty in finding one. But the fact is that in
      this, as in all other instances, the word "model" must be taken in a very
      different sense from that in which it is commonly used in painting. Ibsen
      undoubtedly used models for this trait and that, but never for a whole
      figure. If his characters can be called portraits at all, they are
      composite portraits. Even when it seems pretty clear that the initial
      impulse towards the creation of a particular character came from some
      individual, the original figure is entirely transmuted in the process of
      harmonisation with the dramatic scheme. We need not, therefore, look for a
      definite prototype of Hedda; but Dr. Brandes shows that two of that lady's
      exploits were probably suggested by the anecdotic history of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ibsen had no doubt heard how the wife of a well-known Norwegian composer,
      in a fit of raging jealousy excited by her husband's prolonged absence
      from home, burnt the manuscript of a symphony which he had just finished.
      The circumstances under which Hedda burns Lovborg's manuscript are, of
      course, entirely different and infinitely more dramatic; but here we have
      merely another instance of the dramatisation or "poetisation" of the raw
      material of life. Again, a still more painful incident probably came to
      his knowledge about the same time. A beautiful and very intellectual woman
      was married to a well-known man who had been addicted to drink, but had
      entirely conquered the vice. One day a mad whim seized her to put his
      self-mastery and her power over him to the test. As it happened to be his
      birthday, she rolled into his study a small keg of brandy, and then
      withdrew. She returned some time after wards to find that he had broached
      the keg, and lay insensible on the floor. In this anecdote we cannot but
      recognise the germ, not only of Hedda's temptation of Lovborg, but of a
      large part of her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus," says Dr. Brandes, "out of small and scattered traits of reality
      Ibsen fashioned his close-knit and profoundly thought-out works of art."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the character of Eilert Lovborg, again, Ibsen seem unquestionably to
      have borrowed several traits from a definite original. A young Danish man
      of letters, whom Dr. Brandes calls Holm, was an enthusiastic admirer of
      Ibsen, and came to be on very friendly terms with him. One day Ibsen was
      astonished to receive, in Munich, a parcel addressed from Berlin by this
      young man, containing, without a word of explanation, a packet of his
      (Ibsen's) letters, and a photograph which he had presented to Holm. Ibsen
      brooded and brooded over the incident, and at last came to the conclusion
      that the young man had intended to return her letters and photograph to a
      young lady to whom he was known to be attached, and had in a fit of
      aberration mixed up the two objects of his worship. Some time after, Holm
      appeared at Ibsen's rooms. He talked quite rationally, but professed to
      have no knowledge whatever of the letter-incident, though he admitted the
      truth of Ibsen's conjecture that the "belle dame sans merci" had demanded
      the return of her letters and portrait. Ibsen was determined to get at the
      root of the mystery; and a little inquiry into his young friend's habits
      revealed the fact that he broke his fast on a bottle of port wine,
      consumed a bottle of Rhine wine at lunch, of Burgundy at dinner, and
      finished off the evening with one or two more bottles of port. Then he
      heard, too, how, in the course of a night's carouse, Holm had lost the
      manuscript of a book; and in these traits he saw the outline of the figure
      of Eilert Lovborg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time elapsed, and again Ibsen received a postal packet from Holm.
      This one contained his will, in which Ibsen figured as his residuary
      legatee. But many other legatees were mentioned in the instrument&mdash;all
      of them ladies, such as Fraulein Alma Rothbart, of Bremen, and Fraulein
      Elise Kraushaar, of Berlin. The bequests to these meritorious spinsters
      were so generous that their sum considerably exceeded the amount of the
      testator's property. Ibsen gently but firmly declined the proffered
      inheritance; but Holm's will no doubt suggested to him the figure of that
      red-haired "Mademoiselle Diana," who is heard of but not seen in <i>Hedda
      Gabler</i>, and enabled him to add some further traits to the portraiture
      of Lovborg. When the play appeared, Holm recognised himself with glee in
      the character of the bibulous man of letters, and thereafter adopted
      "Eilert Lovborg" as his pseudonym. I do not, therefore, see why Dr.
      Brandes should suppress his real name; but I willingly imitate him in
      erring on the side of discretion. The poor fellow died several years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some critics have been greatly troubled as to the precise meaning of
      Hedda's fantastic vision of Lovborg "with vine-leaves in his hair." Surely
      this is a very obvious image or symbol of the beautiful, the ideal, aspect
      of bacchic elation and revelry. Antique art, or I am much mistaken, shows
      us many figures of Dionysus himself and his followers with vine-leaves
      entwined their hair. To Ibsen's mind, at any rate, the image had long been
      familiar. In <i>Peer Gynt</i> (Act iv. sc. 8), when Peer, having carried
      off Anitra, finds himself in a particularly festive mood, he cries: "Were
      there vine-leaves around, I would garland my brow." Again, in <i>Emperor
      and Galilean</i> (Pt. ii. Act 1) where Julian, in the procession of
      Dionysus, impersonates the god himself, it is directed that he shall wear
      a wreath of vine-leaves. Professor Dietrichson relates that among the
      young artists whose society Ibsen frequented during his first years in
      Rome, it was customary, at their little festivals, for the revellers to
      deck themselves in this fashion. But the image is so obvious that there is
      no need to trace it to any personal experience. The attempt to place
      Hedda's vine-leaves among Ibsen's obscurities is an example of the firm
      resolution not to understand which animated the criticism of the
      'nineties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Brandes has dealt very severely with the character of Eilert Lovborg,
      alleging that we cannot believe in the genius attributed to him. But where
      is he described as a genius? The poet represents him as a very able
      student of sociology; but that is quite a different thing from attributing
      to him such genius as must necessarily shine forth in every word he
      utters. Dr. Brandes, indeed, declines to believe even in his ability as a
      sociologist, on the ground that it is idle to write about the social
      development of the future. "To our prosaic minds," he says, "it may seem
      as if the most sensible utterance on the subject is that of the fool of
      the play: 'The future! Good heavens, we know nothing of the future.'" The
      best retort to this criticism is that which Eilert himself makes: "There's
      a thing or two to be said about it all the same." The intelligent
      forecasting of the future (as Mr. H. G. Wells has shown) is not only
      clearly distinguishable from fantastic Utopianism, but is indispensable to
      any large statesmanship or enlightened social activity. With very real and
      very great respect for Dr. Brandes, I cannot think that he has been
      fortunate in his treatment of Lovborg's character. It has been represented
      as an absurdity that he would think of reading abstracts from his new book
      to a man like Tesman, whom he despises. But though Tesman is a ninny, he
      is, as Hedda says, a "specialist"&mdash;he is a competent, plodding
      student of his subject. Lovborg may quite naturally wish to see how his
      new method, or his excursion into a new field, strikes the average scholar
      of the Tesman type. He is, in fact, "trying it on the dog"&mdash;neither
      an unreasonable nor an unusual proceeding. There is, no doubt, a certain
      improbability in the way in which Lovborg is represented as carrying his
      manuscript around, and especially in Mrs. Elvsted's production of his
      rough draft from her pocket; but these are mechanical trifles, on which
      only a niggling criticism would dream of laying stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all Ibsen's works, <i>Hedda Gabler</i> is the most detached, the most
      objective&mdash;a character-study pure and simple. It is impossible&mdash;or
      so it seems to me&mdash;to extract any sort of general idea from it. One
      cannot even call it a satire, unless one is prepared to apply that term to
      the record of a "case" in a work of criminology. Reverting to Dumas's
      dictum that a play should contain "a painting, a judgment, an ideal," we
      may say the <i>Hedda Gabler</i> fulfils only the first of these
      requirements. The poet does not even pass judgment on his heroine: he
      simply paints her full-length portrait with scientific impassivity. But
      what a portrait! How searching in insight, how brilliant in colouring, how
      rich in detail! Grant Allen's remark, above quoted, was, of course, a
      whimsical exaggeration; the Hedda type is not so common as all that, else
      the world would quickly come to an end. But particular traits and
      tendencies of the Hedda type are very common in modern life, and not only
      among women. Hyperaesthesia lies at the root of her tragedy. With a keenly
      critical, relentlessly solvent intelligence, she combines a morbid
      shrinking from all the gross and prosaic detail of the sensual life. She
      has nothing to take her out of herself&mdash;not a single intellectual
      interest or moral enthusiasm. She cherishes, in a languid way, a petty
      social ambition; and even that she finds obstructed and baffled. At the
      same time she learns that another woman has had the courage to love and
      venture all, where she, in her cowardice, only hankered and refrained. Her
      malign egoism rises up uncontrolled, and calls to its aid her quick and
      subtle intellect. She ruins the other woman's happiness, but in doing so
      incurs a danger from which her sense of personal dignity revolts. Life has
      no such charm for her that she cares to purchase it at the cost of squalid
      humiliation and self-contempt. The good and the bad in her alike impel her
      to have done with it all; and a pistol-shot ends what is surely one of the
      most poignant character-tragedies in literature. Ibsen's brain never
      worked at higher pressure than in the conception and adjustment of those
      "crowded hours" in which Hedda, tangled in the web of Will and
      Circumstance, struggles on till she is too weary to struggle any more.

      It may not be superfluous to note that the "a" in "Gabler" should be
      sounded long and full, like the "a" in "Garden"&mdash;NOT like the "a" in
      "gable" or in "gabble."

      ACT FIRST.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A spacious, handsome, and tastefully furnished drawing room,
  decorated in dark colours.  In the back, a wide doorway with
  curtains drawn back, leading into a smaller room decorated
  in the same style as the drawing-room.  In the right-hand
  wall of the front room, a folding door leading out to the
  hall.  In the opposite wall, on the left, a glass door, also
  with curtains drawn back.  Through the panes can be seen
  part of a verandah outside, and trees covered with autumn
  foliage.  An oval table, with a cover on it, and surrounded
  by chairs, stands well forward.  In front, by the wall on
  the right, a wide stove of dark porcelain, a high-backed
  arm-chair, a cushioned foot-rest, and two footstools.  A
  settee, with a small round table in front of it, fills the
  upper right-hand corner.  In front, on the left, a little
  way from the wall, a sofa.  Further back than the glass
  door, a piano.  On either side of the doorway at the back
  a whatnot with terra-cotta and majolica ornaments.&mdash;
  Against the back wall of the inner room a sofa, with a
  table, and one or two chairs.  Over the sofa hangs the
  portrait of a handsome elderly man in a General's uniform.
  Over the table a hanging lamp, with an opal glass shade.&mdash;A
  number of bouquets are arranged about the drawing-room, in
  vases and glasses.  Others lie upon the tables.  The floors
  in both rooms are covered with thick carpets.&mdash;Morning light.
  The sun shines in through the glass door.

  MISS JULIANA TESMAN, with her bonnet on a carrying a parasol,
  comes in from the hall, followed by BERTA, who carries a
  bouquet wrapped in paper.  MISS TESMAN is a comely and pleasant-
  looking lady of about sixty-five.  She is nicely but simply
  dressed in a grey walking-costume.  BERTA is a middle-aged
  woman of plain and rather countrified appearance.
</pre>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:] Upon my word, I don't
      believe they are stirring yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Also softly.] I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got in
      last night. And then, when they got home!&mdash;good Lord, what a lot the
      young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well well&mdash;let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they
      get a good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [She goes to the glass door and throws it open.
</pre>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.] I
      declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
      Miss. [She places it on the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
      wrench to me to part with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [On the point of weeping.] And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
      Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.<a
      name="H1a" id="H1a"></a>(<a href="#link1">1</a>))
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
      George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
      to look after him ever since he was a little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless at
      home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never
      learn to take proper care of an invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I shall manage to train her. And of course, you know, I shall take
      most of it upon myself. You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister, my
      dear Berta.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, but there's another thing, Miss. I'm so mortally afraid I shan't be
      able to suit the young mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh well&mdash;just at first there may be one or two things&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most like she'll be terrible grand in her ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you can't wonder at that&mdash;General Gabler's daughter! Think of
      the sort of life she was accustomed to in her father's time. Don't you
      remember how we used to see her riding down the road along with the
      General? In that long black habit&mdash;and with feathers in her hat?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed&mdash;I remember well enough!&mdash;But, good Lord, I should
      never have dreamt in those days that she and Master George would make a
      match of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor I.&mdash;But by-the-bye, Berta&mdash;while I think of it: in future
      you mustn't say Master George. You must say Dr. Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the young mistress spoke of that too&mdash;last night&mdash;the
      moment they set foot in the house. Is it true then, Miss?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed it is. Only think, Berta&mdash;some foreign university has
      made him a doctor&mdash;while he has been abroad, you understand. I hadn't
      heard a word about it, until he told me himself upon the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well well, he's clever enough for anything, he is. But I didn't think he'd
      have gone in for doctoring people.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No no, it's not that sort of doctor he is. [Nods significantly.] But let
      me tell you, we may have to call him something still grander before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't say so! What can that be, Miss?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiling.] H'm&mdash;wouldn't you like to know! [With emotion.] Ah, dear
      dear&mdash;if my poor brother could only look up from his grave now, and
      see what his little boy has grown into! [Looks around.] But bless me,
      Berta&mdash;why have you done this? Taken the chintz covers off all the
      furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress told me to. She can't abide covers on the chairs, she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are they going to make this their everyday sitting-room then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that's what I understood&mdash;from the mistress. Master George&mdash;the
      doctor&mdash;he said nothing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  GEORGE TESMAN comes from the right into the inner room,
  humming to himself, and carrying an unstrapped empty
  portmanteau.  He is a middle-sized, young-looking man of
  thirty-three, rather stout, with a round, open, cheerful
  face, fair hair and beard.  He wears spectacles, and is
  somewhat carelessly dressed in comfortable indoor clothes.
</pre>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good morning, good morning, George.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In the doorway between the rooms.] Aunt Julia! Dear Aunt Julia! [Goes up
      to her and shakes hands warmly.] Come all this way&mdash;so early! Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that makes no difference to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I suppose you got home all right from the pier? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, quite safely, thank goodness. Judge Brack was good enough to see me
      right to my door.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were so sorry we couldn't give you a seat in the carriage. But you saw
      what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she had certainly plenty of boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [To TESMAN.] Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the
      mistress?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No thank you, Berta&mdash;you needn't. She said she would ring if she
      wanted anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Going towards the right.] Very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But look here&mdash;take this portmanteau with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Taking it.] I'll put it in the attic.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [She goes out by the hall door.
</pre>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy, Auntie&mdash;I had the whole of that portmanteau chock full of
      copies of the documents. You wouldn't believe how much I have picked up
      from all the archives I have been examining&mdash;curious old details that
      no one has had any idea of&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, you don't seem to have wasted your time on your wedding trip, George.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that I haven't. But do take off your bonnet, Auntie. Look here! Let me
      untie the strings&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [While he does so.] Well well&mdash;this is just as if you were still at
      home with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With the bonnet in his hand, looks at it from all sides.] Why, what a
      gorgeous bonnet you've been investing in!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bought it on Hedda's account.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Hedda's account? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, so that Hedda needn't be ashamed of me if we happened to go out
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Patting her cheek.] You always think of everything, Aunt Julia. [Lays the
      bonnet on a chair beside the table.] And now, look here&mdash;suppose we
      sit comfortably on the sofa and have a little chat, till Hedda comes.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [They seat themselves.  She places her parasol in the corner
       of the sofa.
</pre>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Takes both his hands and looks at him.] What a delight it is to have you
      again, as large as life, before my very eyes, George! My George&mdash;my
      poor brother's own boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it's a delight for me, too, to see you again, Aunt Julia! You, who
      have been father and mother in one to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, I know you will always keep a place in your heart for your old
      aunts.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what about Aunt Rina? No improvement&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no&mdash;we can scarcely look for any improvement in her case, poor
      thing. There she lies, helpless, as she has lain for all these years. But
      heaven grant I may not lose her yet awhile! For if I did, I don't know
      what I should make of my life, George&mdash;especially now that I haven't
      you to look after any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Patting her back.] There there there&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Suddenly changing her tone.] And to think that here are you a married
      man, George!&mdash;And that you should be the one to carry off Hedda
      Gabler &mdash;the beautiful Hedda Gabler! Only think of it&mdash;she, that
      was so beset with admirers!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Hums a little and smiles complacently.] Yes, I fancy I have several good
      friends about town who would like to stand in my shoes&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then this fine long wedding-tour you have had! More than five&mdash;
      nearly six months&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, for me it has been a sort of tour of research as well. I have had to
      do so much grubbing among old records&mdash;and to read no end of books
      too, Auntie.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, I suppose so. [More confidentially, and lowering her voice a
      little.] But listen now, George,&mdash;have you nothing&mdash;nothing
      special to tell me?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to our journey?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I don't know of anything except what I have told you in my letters. I
      had a doctor's degree conferred on me&mdash;but that I told you yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, you did. But what I mean is&mdash;haven't you any&mdash;any&mdash;
      expectations&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expectations?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why you know, George&mdash;I'm your old auntie!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, of course I have expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have every expectation of being a professor one of these days.

    <p>
      Oh yes, a professor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, I may say I am certain of it. But my dear Auntie&mdash;you know
      all about that already!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing to herself.] Yes, of course I do. You are quite right there.
      [Changing the subject.] But we were talking about your journey. It must
      have cost a great deal of money, George?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you see&mdash;my handsome travelling-scholarship went a good way.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I can't understand how you can have made it go far enough for two.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that's not easy to understand&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And especially travelling with a lady&mdash;they tell me that makes it
      ever so much more expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, of course&mdash;it makes it a little more expensive. But Hedda had to
      have this trip, Auntie! She really had to. Nothing else would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No no, I suppose not. A wedding-tour seems to be quite indispensable
      nowadays.&mdash;But tell me now&mdash;have you gone thoroughly over the
      house yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, you may be sure I have. I have been afoot ever since daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what do you think of it all?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm delighted! Quite delighted! Only I can't think what we are to do with
      the two empty rooms between this inner parlour and Hedda's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing.] Oh my dear George, I daresay you may find some use for them&mdash;in
      the course of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why of course you are quite right, Aunt Julia! You mean as my library
      increases&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, quite so, my dear boy. It was your library I was thinking of.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am specially pleased on Hedda's account. Often and often, before we were
      engaged, she said that she would never care to live anywhere but in
      Secretary Falk's villa.<a name="H2a" id="H2a"></a>(<a href="#link2">2</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was lucky that this very house should come into the market, just
      after you had started.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Aunt Julia, the luck was on our side, wasn't it&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the expense, my dear George! You will find it very expensive, all
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at her, a little cast down.] Yes, I suppose I shall, Aunt!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, frightfully!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much do you think? In round numbers?&mdash;Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I can't even guess until all the accounts come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, fortunately, Judge Brack has secured the most favourable terms for
      me, so he said in a letter to Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, don't be uneasy, my dear boy.&mdash;Besides, I have given security
      for the furniture and all the carpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security? You? My dear Aunt Julia&mdash;what sort of security could you
      give?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have given a mortgage on our annuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jumps up.] What! On your&mdash;and Aunt Rina's annuity!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I knew of no other plan, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Placing himself before her.] Have you gone out of your senses, Auntie?
      Your annuity&mdash;it's all that you and Aunt Rina have to live upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well well&mdash;don't get so excited about it. It's only a matter of form
      you know&mdash;Judge Brack assured me of that. It was he that was kind
      enough to arrange the whole affair for me. A mere matter of form, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that may be all very well. But nevertheless&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have your own salary to depend upon now. And, good heavens, even
      if we did have to pay up a little&mdash;! To eke things out a bit at the
      start&mdash;! Why, it would be nothing but a pleasure to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh Auntie&mdash;will you never be tired of making sacrifices for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rises and lays her hand on his shoulders.] Have I any other happiness in
      this world except to smooth your way for you, my dear boy. You, who have
      had neither father nor mother to depend on. And now we have reached the
      goal, George! Things have looked black enough for us, sometimes; but,
      thank heaven, now you have nothing to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it is really marvellous how every thing has turned out for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the people who opposed you&mdash;who wanted to bar the way for you&mdash;
      now you have them at your feet. They have fallen, George. Your most
      dangerous rival&mdash;his fall was the worst.&mdash;And now he has to lie
      on the bed he has made for himself&mdash;poor misguided creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you heard anything of Eilert? Since I went away, I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only that he is said to have published a new book.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      What! Eilert Lovborg! Recently&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, so they say. Heaven knows whether it can be worth anything! Ah, when
      your new book appears&mdash;that will be another story, George! What is it
      to be about?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will deal with the domestic industries of Brabant during the Middle
      Ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy&mdash;to be able to write on such a subject as that!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it may be some time before the book is ready. I have all these
      collections to arrange first, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, collecting and arranging&mdash;no one can beat you at that. There you
      are my poor brother's own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am looking forward eagerly to setting to work at it; especially now that
      I have my own delightful home to work in.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, most of all, now that you have got the wife of your heart, my dear
      George.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Embracing her.] Oh yes, yes, Aunt Julia! Hedda&mdash;she is the best part
      of it all! I believe I hear her coming&mdash;eh?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  HEDDA enters from the left through the inner room.  Her face
  and figure show refinement and distinction.  Her complexion
  is pale and opaque.  Her steel-grey eyes express a cold,
  unruffled repose.  Her hair is of an agreeable brown, but
  not particularly abundant.  She is dressed in a tasteful,
  somewhat loose-fitting morning gown.
</pre>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Going to meet HEDDA.] Good morning, my dear Hedda! Good morning, and a
      hearty welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Holds out her hand.] Good morning, dear Miss Tesman! So early a call!
      That is kind of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With some embarrassment.] Well&mdash;has the bride slept well in her new
      home?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, thanks. Passably.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing.] Passably! Come, that's good, Hedda! You were sleeping like a
      stone when I got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately. Of course one has always to accustom one's self to new
      surroundings, Miss Tesman&mdash;little by little. [Looking towards the
      left.] Oh, there the servant has gone and opened the veranda door, and let
      in a whole flood of sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Going towards the door.] Well, then we will shut it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No no, not that! Tesman, please draw the curtains. That will give a softer
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At the door.] All right&mdash;all right.&mdash;There now, Hedda, now you
      have both shade and fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, fresh air we certainly must have, with all these stacks of flowers&mdash;.
      But&mdash;won't you sit down, Miss Tesman?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, thank you. Now that I have seen that everything is all right here&mdash;thank
      heaven!&mdash;I must be getting home again. My sister is lying longing for
      me, poor thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give her my very best love, Auntie; and say I shall look in and see her
      later in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, I'll be sure to tell her. But by-the-bye, George&mdash;[Feeling
      in her dress pocket]&mdash;I had almost forgotten&mdash;I have something
      for you here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it, Auntie? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Produces a flat parcel wrapped in newspaper and hands it to him.] Look
      here, my dear boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Opening the parcel.] Well, I declare!&mdash;Have you really saved them
      for me, Aunt Julia! Hedda! isn't this touching&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Beside the whatnot on the right.] Well, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      My old morning-shoes! My slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed. I remember you often spoke of them while we were abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I missed them terribly. [Goes up to her.] Now you shall see them,
      Hedda!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Going towards the stove.] Thanks, I really don't care about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Following her.] Only think&mdash;ill as she was, Aunt Rina embroidered
      these for me. Oh you can't think how many associations cling to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At the table.] Scarcely for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course not for Hedda, George.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, but now that she belongs to the family, I thought&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Interrupting.] We shall never get on with this servant, Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not get on with Berta?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, dear, what puts that in your head? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pointing.] Look there! She has left her old bonnet lying about on a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In consternation, drops the slippers on the floor.] Why, Hedda&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just fancy, if any one should come in and see it!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hedda&mdash;that's Aunt Julia's bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Taking up the bonnet.] Yes, indeed it's mine. And, what's more, it's not
      old, Madam Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really did not look closely at it, Miss Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Trying on the bonnet.] Let me tell you it's the first time I have worn it&mdash;the
      very first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a very nice bonnet it is too&mdash;quite a beauty!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it's no such great things, George. [Looks around her.] My parasol&mdash;?
      Ah, here. [Takes it.] For this is mine too&mdash; [mutters] &mdash;not
      Berta's.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new bonnet and a new parasol! Only think, Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very handsome indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, isn't it? Eh? But Auntie, take a good look at Hedda before you go!
      See how handsome she is!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, my dear boy, there's nothing new in that. Hedda was always lovely.

    <p>
      TESMAN.

      How she has filled out on the journey?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.

    <p>
      TESMAN.

      Of course you don't notice it so much now that she has that dress on. But

    </p>
    <p>
      So you insist; but I'm quite certain you are not. Don't you agree with me,
      Auntie?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Who has been gazing at her with folded hands.] Hedda is lovely&mdash;
      lovely&mdash;lovely. [Goes up to her, takes her head between both hands,
      draws it downwards, and kisses her hair.] God bless and preserve Hedda
      Tesman&mdash;for George's sake.

    <p>
      HEDDA.

       door remains half open.  TESMAN can be heard repeating his
       message to Aunt Rina and his thanks for the slippers.

     [In the meantime, HEDDA walks about the room, raising her arms
       and clenching her hands as if in desperation.  Then she flings
       back the curtains from the glass door, and stands there looking
       out.

     [Presently, TESMAN returns and closes the door behind him.
</pre>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Picks up the slippers from the floor.] What are you looking at, Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Once more calm and mistress of herself.] I am only looking at the leaves.
      They are so yellow&mdash;so withered.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Wraps up the slippers and lays them on the table.] Well, you see, we are
      well into September now.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Again restless.] Yes, to think of it!&mdash;already in&mdash;in
      September.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't you think Aunt Julia's manner was strange, dear? Almost solemn? Can
      you imagine what was the matter with her? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely know her, you see. Is she not often like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not as she was to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Leaving the glass door.] Do you think she was annoyed about the bonnet?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, scarcely at all. Perhaps a little, just at the moment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what an idea, to pitch her bonnet about in the drawing-room! No one
      does that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well you may be sure Aunt Julia won't do it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, I shall manage to make my peace with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, my dear, good Hedda, if you only would.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you call this afternoon, you might invite her to spend the evening
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that I will. And there's one thing more you could do that would
      delight her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you could only prevail on yourself to say <i>du</i><a name="H3a"
      id="H3a"></a>(<a href="#link3">3</a>) to her. For my sake, Hedda? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, Tesman&mdash;you really mustn't ask that of me. I have told you so
      already. I shall try to call her "Aunt"; and you must be satisfied with
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well well. Only I think now that you belong to the family, you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      H'm&mdash;I can't in the least see why&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [She goes up towards the middle doorway.
</pre>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [After a pause.] Is there anything the matter with you, Hedda? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm only looking at my old piano. It doesn't go at all well with all the
      other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time I draw my salary, we'll see about exchanging it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no&mdash;no exchanging. I don't want to part with it. Suppose we put
      it there in the inner room, and then get another here in its place. When
      it's convenient, I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A little taken aback.] Yes&mdash;of course we could do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Takes up the bouquet from the piano.] These flowers were not here last
      night when we arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Julia must have brought them for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Examining the bouquet.] A visiting-card. [Takes it out and reads:] "Shall
      return later in the day." Can you guess whose card it is?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Whose? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name is "Mrs. Elvsted."
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it really? Sheriff Elvsted's wife? Miss Rysing that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly. The girl with the irritating hair, that she was always showing
      off. An old flame of yours I've been told.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing.] Oh, that didn't last long; and it was before I met you, Hedda.
      But fancy her being in town!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's odd that she should call upon us. I have scarcely seen her since we
      left school.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't see her either for&mdash;heaven knows how long. I wonder how she
      can endure to live in such an out-of-the way hole&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [After a moment's thought, says suddenly.] Tell me, Tesman&mdash;isn't it
      somewhere near there that he&mdash;that&mdash;Eilert Lovborg is living?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.

      Yes, he is somewhere in that part of the country.

      BERTA.

      HEDDA.

  BERTA opens the door for MRS. ELVSTED, and goes out herself.
  &mdash;MRS. ELVSTED is a woman of fragile figure, with pretty,
  soft features.  Her eyes are light blue, large, round, and
  somewhat prominent, with a startled, inquiring expression.
  Her hair is remarkably light, almost flaxen, and unusually
  abundant and wavy.  She is a couple of years younger than
  HEDDA.  She wears a dark visiting dress, tasteful, but not
  quite in the latest fashion.

      MRS. ELVSTED.

      He has been here a week already. Just fancy&mdash;a whole week! In this
      terrible town, alone! With so many temptations on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, my dear Mrs. Elvsted&mdash;how does he concern you so much?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at her with a startled air, and says rapidly.] He was the

      Your children's?

    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last two years his conduct has been irreproachable.

    </p>

      Perfectly irreproachable, I assure you! In every respect. But all the same&mdash;now
      that I know he is here&mdash;in this great town&mdash;and with a large sum
      of money in his hands&mdash;I can't help being in mortal fear for him.

    <p>
      TESMAN.

      Why did he not remain where he was? With you and your husband? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his book was published he was too restless and unsettled to remain
      with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, by-the-bye, Aunt Julia told me he had published a new book.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, a big book, dealing with the march of civilisation&mdash;in broad
      outline, as it were. It came out about a fortnight ago. And since it has
      sold so well, and been so much read&mdash;and made such a sensation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Has it indeed? It must be something he has had lying by since his better
      days.

      Yes.

    </p>
    <p>
      No, he has written it all since he has been with us&mdash;within the last
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isn't that good news, Hedda? Think of that.

    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not yet. I have had the greatest difficulty in finding out his
      address. But this morning I discovered it at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks searchingly at her.] Do you know, it seems to me a little odd of
      your husband&mdash;h'm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Starting nervously.] Of my husband! What?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he should send you to town on such an errand&mdash;that he does not
      come himself and look after his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh no, no&mdash;my husband has no time. And besides, I&mdash;I had some
      shopping to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With a slight smile.] Ah, that is a different matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising quickly and uneasily.] And now I beg and implore you, Mr. Tesman&mdash;receive
      Eilert Lovborg kindly if he comes to you! And that he is sure to do. You
      see you were such great friends in the old days. And then you are
      interested in the same studies&mdash;the same branch of science&mdash;so
      far as I can understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      We used to be at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is why I beg so earnestly that you&mdash;you too&mdash;will keep a
      sharp eye upon him. Oh, you will promise me that, Mr. Tesman&mdash;won't
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the greatest of pleasure, Mrs. Rysing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elvsted.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assure you I shall do all I possibly can for Eilert. You may rely upon
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how very, very kind of you! [Presses his hands.] Thanks, thanks,
      thanks! [Frightened.] You see, my husband is so very fond of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising.] You ought to write to him, Tesman. Perhaps he may not care to
      come to you of his own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, perhaps it would be the right thing to do, Hedda? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sooner the better. Why not at once?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Imploringly.] Oh, if you only would!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll write this moment. Have you his address, Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Elvsted.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. [Takes a slip of paper from her pocket, and hands it to him.] Here it
      is.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good, good. Then I'll go in&mdash; [Looks about him.] By-the-bye,&mdash;my
      slippers? Oh, here. [Takes the packet and is about to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure you write him a cordial, friendly letter. And a good long one too.

      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      But please, please don't say a word to show that I have suggested it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, how could you think I would? Eh?

      killed two birds with one stone.

    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could you not see that I wanted him to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, to write the letter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that I might speak to you alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Confused.] About the same thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Apprehensively.] But there is nothing more, Mrs. Tesman! Absolutely
      nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, but there is. There is a great deal more&mdash;I can see that. Sit
      here&mdash;and we'll have a cosy, confidential chat.

    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Anxiously, looking at her watch.] But, my dear Mrs. Tesman&mdash;I was
      really on the point of going.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, you can't be in such a hurry.&mdash;Well? Now tell me something about
      your life at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that is just what I care least to speak about.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to me, dear&mdash;? Why, weren't we schoolfellows?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but you were in the class above me. Oh, how dreadfully afraid of you
      I was then!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afraid of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, dreadfully. For when we met on the stairs you used always to pull my
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I, really?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and once you said you would burn it off my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh that was all nonsense, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but I was so silly in those days.&mdash;And since then, too&mdash;we
      have drifted so far&mdash;far apart from each other. Our circles have been
      so entirely different.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, we must try to drift together again. Now listen. At school we
      said <i>du</i><a name="H4a" id="H4a"></a>(<a href="#link4">4</a>) to
      each other; and we called each other by our Christian names&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I am sure you must be mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not at all! I can remember quite distinctly. So now we are going to
      renew our old friendship. [Draws the footstool closer to MRS. ELVSTED.]
      There now! [Kisses her cheek.] You must say <i>du</i> to me and call me
      Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Presses and pats her hands.] Oh, how good and kind you are! I am not used
      to such kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, there, there! And I shall say <i>du</i> to you, as in the old days,
      and call you my dear Thora.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Thea.<a name="H5a" id="H5a"></a>(<a href="#link5">5</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, of course! I meant Thea. [Looks at her compassionately.] So you are
      not accustomed to goodness and kindness, Thea? Not in your own home?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if I only had a home! But I haven't any; I have never had a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at her for a moment.] I almost suspected as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gazing helplessly before her.] Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't quite remember&mdash;was it not as housekeeper that you first went
      to Mr. Elvsted's?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really went as governess. But his wife&mdash;his late wife&mdash;was an
      invalid,&mdash;and rarely left her room. So I had to look after the
      housekeeping as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;at last&mdash;you became mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Sadly.] Yes, I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me see&mdash;about how long ago was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      My marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure; it must be that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh those five years&mdash;! Or at all events the last two or three of
      them! Oh, if you<a name="H6a" id="H6a"></a>(<a href="#link6">6</a>)
      could only imagine&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Giving her a little slap on the hand.] De? Fie, Thea!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, I will try&mdash;. Well, if&mdash;you could only imagine and
      understand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Lightly.] Eilert Lovborg has been in your neighbourhood about three
      years, hasn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at here doubtfully.] Eilert Lovborg? Yes&mdash;he has.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had you known him before, in town here?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely at all. I mean&mdash;I knew him by name of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you saw a good deal of him in the country?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he came to us every day. You see, he gave the children lessons; for
      in the long run I couldn't manage it all myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that's clear.&mdash;And your husband&mdash;? I suppose he is often
      away from home?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Being sheriff, you know, he has to travel about a good deal in his
      district.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Leaning against the arm of the chair.] Thea&mdash;my poor, sweet Thea&mdash;now
      you must tell me everything&mdash;exactly as it stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then you must question me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sort of a man is your husband, Thea? I mean&mdash;you know&mdash;in
      everyday life. Is he kind to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Evasively.] I am sure he means well in everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should think he must be altogether too old for you. There is at least
      twenty years' difference between you, is there not?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Irritably.] Yes, that is true, too. Everything about him is repellent to
      me! We have not a thought in common. We have no single point of sympathy&mdash;he
      and I.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is he not fond of you all the same? In his own way?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh I really don't know. I think he regards me simply as a useful property.
      And then it doesn't cost much to keep me. I am not expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is stupid of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shakes her head.] It cannot be otherwise&mdash;not with him. I don't
      think he really cares for any one but himself&mdash;and perhaps a little
      for the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for Eilert Lovborg, Thea?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking at her.] For Eilert Lovborg? What puts that into your head?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, my dear&mdash;I should say, when he sends you after him all the way
      to town&mdash; [Smiling almost imperceptibly.] And besides, you said so
      yourself, to Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With a little nervous twitch.] Did I? Yes, I suppose I did. [Vehemently,
      but not loudly.] No&mdash;I may just as well make a clean breast of it at
      once! For it must all come out in any case.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, my dear Thea&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, to make a long story short: My husband did not know that I was
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What! Your husband didn't know it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, of course not. For that matter, he was away from home himself&mdash;
      he was travelling. Oh, I could bear it no longer, Hedda! I couldn't indeed&mdash;so
      utterly alone as I should have been in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well? And then?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I put together some of my things&mdash;what I needed most&mdash;as
      quietly as possible. And then I left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;and took the train to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, my dear, good Thea&mdash;to think of you daring to do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rises and moves about the room.] What else could I possibly do?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what do you think your husband will say when you go home again?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At the table, looks at her.] Back to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never go back to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising and going towards her.] Then you have left your home&mdash;for
      good and all?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. There was nothing else to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then&mdash;to take flight so openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it's impossible to keep things of that sort secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what do you think people will say of you, Thea?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      They may say what they like, for aught <i>I</i> care. [Seats herself
      wearily and sadly on the sofa.] I have done nothing but what I had to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [After a short silence.] And what are your plans now? What do you think of
      doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know yet. I only know this, that I must live here, where Eilert
      Lovborg is&mdash;if I am to live at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Takes a chair from the table, seats herself beside her, and strokes her
      hands.] My dear Thea&mdash;how did this&mdash;this friendship&mdash;between
      you and Eilert Lovborg come about?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh it grew up gradually. I gained a sort of influence over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave up his old habits. Not because I asked him to, for I never dared
      do that. But of course he saw how repulsive they were to me; and so he
      dropped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Concealing an involuntary smile of scorn.] Then you have reclaimed him&mdash;as
      the saying goes&mdash;my little Thea.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he says himself, at any rate. And he, on his side, has made a real
      human being of me&mdash;taught me to think, and to understand so many
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he give you lessons too, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not exactly lessons. But he talked to me&mdash;talked about such an
      infinity of things. And then came the lovely, happy time when I began to
      share in his work&mdash;when he allowed me to help him!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh he did, did he?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! He never wrote anything without my assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You were two good comrades, in fact?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Eagerly.] Comrades! Yes, fancy, Hedda&mdash;that is the very word he
      used!&mdash;Oh, I ought to feel perfectly happy; and yet I cannot; for I
      don't know how long it will last.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you no surer of him than that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gloomily.] A woman's shadow stands between Eilert Lovborg and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at her anxiously.] Who can that be?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know. Some one he knew in his&mdash;in his past. Some one he has
      never been able wholly to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has he told you&mdash;about this?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has only once&mdash;quite vaguely&mdash;alluded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! And what did he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that when they parted, she threatened to shoot him with a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With cold composure.] Oh nonsense! No one does that sort of thing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. And that is why I think it must have been that red-haired
      singing-woman whom he once&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, very likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      For I remember they used to say of her that she carried loaded firearms.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh&mdash;then of course it must have been she.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Wringing her hands.] And now just fancy, Hedda&mdash;I hear that this
      singing-woman&mdash;that she is in town again! Oh, I don't know what to do&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Glancing towards the inner room.] Hush! Here comes Tesman. [Rises and
      whispers.] Thea&mdash;all this must remain between you and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Springing up.] Oh yes&mdash;yes! For heaven's sake&mdash;!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  GEORGE TESMAN, with a letter in his hand, comes from the right
  through the inner room.

      There now&mdash;the epistle is finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's right. And now Mrs. Elvsted is just going. Wait a moment&mdash;I'll
      go with you to the garden gate.

      Yes, ask Judge Brack to come in. And look here&mdash;put this letter in

   [She opens the door for JUDGE BRACK and goes out herself.  Brack
       is a main of forty-five; thick set, but well-built and elastic
       in his movements.  His face is roundish with an aristocratic
       profile.  His hair is short, still almost black, and carefully
       dressed.  His eyebrows thick.  His moustaches are also thick,
       with short-cut ends.  He wears a well-cut walking-suit, a
       little too youthful for his age.  He uses an eye-glass, which
       he now and then lets drop.

    <p>
      JUDGE BRACK.

    <p>
      [With his hat in his hand, bowing.] May one venture to call so early in
      the day?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course one may.

    <p>
      [Looks at him and laughs.] It's nice to have a look at you by daylight,
      Judge!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you find me&mdash;altered?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little younger, I think.

    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you so much.
    </p>
    <p>

      has actually&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, do leave me alone. You haven't thanked Judge Brack for all the trouble
      he has taken&mdash;
    </p>

      BRACK.

      HEDDA.

    <p>
      Yes, you are a friend indeed. But here stands Thea all impatience to be
      off&mdash;so <i>au revoir</i> Judge. I shall be back again presently.

    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, we can't thank you sufficiently. Of course she talks of a little
      re-arrangement here and there; and one or two things are still wanting. We
      shall have to buy some additional trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we won't trouble you about these things. Hedda say she herself will
      look after what is wanting.&mdash;Shan't we sit down? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks, for a moment. [Seats himself beside the table.] There is something
      I wanted to speak to about, my dear Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed? Ah, I understand! [Seating himself.] I suppose it's the serious
      part of the frolic that is coming now. Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the money question is not so very pressing; though, for that matter, I
      wish we had gone a little more economically to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that would never have done, you know! Think of Hedda, my dear fellow!
      You, who know her so well&mdash;! I couldn't possibly ask her to put up
      with a shabby style of living!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no&mdash;that is just the difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;fortunately&mdash;it can't be long before I receive my
      appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you see&mdash;such things are often apt to hang fire for a long
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you heard anything definite? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing exactly definite&mdash;. [Interrupting himself.] But by-the-bye&mdash;I
      have one piece of news for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your old friend, Eilert Lovborg, has returned to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that already.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed! How did you learn it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that lady who went out with Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really? What was her name? I didn't quite catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Elvsted.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aha&mdash;Sheriff Elvsted's wife? Of course&mdash;he has been living up in
      their regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And fancy&mdash;I'm delighted to hear that he is quite a reformed
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he has published a new book&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, indeed he has.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I hear it has made some sensation!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite an unusual sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy&mdash;isn't that good news! A man of such extraordinary talents&mdash;.
      I felt so grieved to think that he had gone irretrievably to ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what everybody thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I cannot imagine what he will take to now! How in the world will he be
      able to make his living? Eh?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [During the last words, HEDDA has entered by the hall door.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [To BRACK, laughing with a touch of scorn.] Tesman is for ever worrying
      about how people are to make their living.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well you see, dear&mdash;we were talking about poor Eilert Lovborg.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Glancing at him rapidly.] Oh, indeed? [Sets herself in the arm-chair
      beside the stove and asks indifferently:] What is the matter with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;no doubt he has run through all his property long ago; and he
      can scarcely write a new book every year&mdash;eh? So I really can't see
      what is to become of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I can give you some information on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must remember that his relations have a good deal of influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, his relations, unfortunately, have entirely washed their hands of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time they called him the hope of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time, yes! But he has put an end to all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who knows? [With a slight smile.] I hear they have reclaimed him up at
      Sheriff Elvsted's&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then this book that he has published&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well well, I hope to goodness they may find something for him to do. I
      have just written to him. I asked him to come and see us this evening,
      Hedda dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my dear fellow, you are booked for my bachelor's party this evening.
      You promised on the pier last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had you forgotten, Tesman?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I had utterly forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it doesn't matter, for you may be sure he won't come.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes you think that? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With a little hesitation, rising and resting his hands on the back of his
      chair.] My dear Tesman&mdash;and you too, Mrs. Tesman&mdash;I think I
      ought not to keep you in the dark about something that&mdash;that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      That concerns Eilert&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both you and him.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, my dear Judge, out with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must be prepared to find your appointment deferred longer than you
      desired or expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jumping up uneasily.] Is there some hitch about it? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nomination may perhaps be made conditional on the result of a
      competition&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Competition! Think of that, Hedda!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Leans further back in the chair.] Aha&mdash;aha!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who can my competitor be? Surely not&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, precisely&mdash;Eilert Lovborg.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Clasping his hands.] No, no&mdash;it's quite impossible! Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      H'm&mdash;that is what it may come to, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well but, Judge Brack&mdash;it would show the most incredible lack of
      consideration for me. [Gesticulates with his arms.] For&mdash;just think&mdash;I'm
      a married man! We have married on the strength of these prospects, Hedda
      and I; and run deep into debt; and borrowed money from Aunt Julia too.
      Good heavens, they had as good as promised me the appointment. Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well, well&mdash;no doubt you will get it in the end; only after a
      contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Immovable in her arm-chair.] Fancy, Tesman, there will be a sort of
      sporting interest in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, my dearest Hedda, how can you be so indifferent about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [As before.] I am not at all indifferent. I am most eager to see who wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, Mrs. Tesman, it is best that you should know how matters
      stand. I mean&mdash;before you set about the little purchases I hear you
      are threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can make no difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed! Then I have no more to say. Good-bye! [To TESMAN.] I shall look in
      on my way back from my afternoon walk, and take you home with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, yes&mdash;your news has quite upset me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Reclining, holds out her hand.] Good-bye, Judge; and be sure you call in
      the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many thanks. Good-bye, good-bye!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Accompanying him to the door.] Good-bye my dear Judge! You must really
      excuse me&mdash; [JUDGE BRACK goes out by the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Crosses the room.] Oh Hedda&mdash;one should never rush into adventures.
      Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at him, smiling.] Do you do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, dear&mdash;there is no denying&mdash;it was adventurous to go and
      marry and set up house upon mere expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you are right there.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;at all events, we have our delightful home, Hedda! Fancy, the
      home we both dreamed of&mdash;the home we were in love with, I may almost
      say. Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising slowly and wearily.] It was part of our compact that we were to go
      into society&mdash;to keep open house.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, if you only knew how I had been looking forward to it! Fancy&mdash;to
      see you as hostess&mdash;in a select circle! Eh? Well, well, well&mdash;for
      the present we shall have to get on without society, Hedda&mdash;only to
      invite Aunt Julia now and then.&mdash;Oh, I intended you to lead such an
      utterly different life, dear&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I cannot have my man in livery just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no, unfortunately. It would be out of the question for us to keep a
      footman, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the saddle-horse I was to have had&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Aghast.] The saddle-horse!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;I suppose I must not think of that now.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heavens, no!&mdash;that's as clear as daylight!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Goes up the room.] Well, I shall have one thing at least to kill time
      with in the meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Beaming.] Oh thank heaven for that! What is it, Hedda. Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In the middle doorway, looks at him with covert scorn.] My pistols,
      George.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In alarm.] Your pistols!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With cold eyes.] General Gabler's pistols.

      ACT SECOND.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The room at the TESMANS' as in the first Act, except that the
  piano has been removed, and an elegant little writing-table
  with the book-shelves put in its place.  A smaller table
  stands near the sofa on the left.  Most of the bouquets have
  been taken away.  MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the large
  table in front.&mdash;It is afternoon.

  HEDDA, dressed to receive callers, is alone in the room. She
  stands by the open glass door, loading a revolver.  The
  fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the writing-
  table.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks down the garden, and calls:] So you are here again, Judge!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Is heard calling from a distance.] As you see, Mrs. Tesman!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Raises the pistol and points.] Now I'll shoot you, Judge Brack!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Calling unseen.] No, no, no! Don't stand aiming at me!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way.<a name="H7a"
      id="H7a"></a>(<a href="#link7">7</a>) [She fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nearer.] Are you out of your senses&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear me&mdash;did I happen to hit you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Still outside.] I wish you would let these pranks alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come in then, Judge.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
  the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.
</pre>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the deuce&mdash;haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
      shooting at?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I am only firing in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gently takes the pistol out of her hand.] Allow me, madam! [Looks at it.]
      Ah&mdash;I know this pistol well! [Looks around.] Where is the case? Ah,
      here it is. [Lays the pistol in it, and shuts it.] Now we won't play at
      that game any more to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you had no visitors?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Closing the glass door.] Not one. I suppose all our set are still out of
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      And is Tesman not at home either?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At the writing-table, putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she
      shuts.] No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't
      expect you so early.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      H'm&mdash;how stupid of me not to have thought of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Turning her head to look at him.] Why stupid?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little&mdash;earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Crossing the room.] Then you would have found no one to receive you; for
      I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley through?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have forgotten to arrange one.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was another piece of stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we must just settle down here&mdash;and wait. Tesman is not likely
      to be back for some time yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never mind; I shall not be impatient.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  HEDDA seats herself in the corner of the sofa.  BRACK lays his
  overcoat over the back of the nearest chair, and sits down, but
  keeps his hat in his hand.  A short silence.  They look at each
  other.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In the same tone.] Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bending a little forward.] Come, let us have a cosy little chat, Mrs.
      Hedda.<a name="H8a" id="H8a"></a>(<a href="#link8">8</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Leaning further back in the sofa.] Does it not seem like a whole eternity
      since our last talk? Of course I don't count those few words yesterday
      evening and this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      You mean since out last confidential talk? Our last <i>tete-a-tete</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well yes&mdash;since you put it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a day passed but I have wished that you were home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I have done nothing but wish the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      You? Really, Mrs. Hedda? And I thought you had been enjoying your tour so
      much!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, you may be sure of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tesman's letters spoke of nothing but happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Tesman! You see, he thinks nothing is so delightful as grubbing in
      libraries and making copies of old parchments, or whatever you call them.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With a smile of malice.] Well, that is his vocation in life&mdash;or part
      of it at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, of course; and no doubt when it's your vocation&mdash;. But <i>I</i>!
      Oh, my dear Mr. Brack, how mortally bored I have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Sympathetically.] Do you really say so? In downright earnest?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, you can surely understand it&mdash;! To go for six whole months
      without meeting a soul that knew anything of our circle, or could talk
      about things we were interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes&mdash;I too should feel that a deprivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, what I found most intolerable of all&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;was being everlastingly in the company of&mdash;one and the same
      person&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With a nod of assent.] Morning, noon, and night, yes&mdash;at all
      possible times and seasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said "everlastingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just so. But I should have thought, with our excellent Tesman, one could&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tesman is&mdash;a specialist, my dear Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And specialists are not at all amusing to travel with. Not in the long run
      at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even&mdash;the specialist one happens to love?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faugh&mdash;don't use that sickening word!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Taken aback.] What do you say, Mrs. Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Half laughing, half irritated.] You should just try it! To hear of
      nothing but the history of civilisation, morning, noon, and night&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everlastingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes yes yes! And then all this about the domestic industry of the middle
      ages&mdash;! That's the most disgusting part of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks searchingly at her.] But tell me&mdash;in that case, how am I to
      understand your&mdash;? H'm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      My accepting George Tesman, you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, let us put it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heavens, do you see anything so wonderful in that?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes and no&mdash;Mrs. Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had positively danced myself tired, my dear Judge. My day was done&mdash;
      [With a slight shudder.] Oh no&mdash;I won't say that; nor think it
      either!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have assuredly no reason to.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, reasons&mdash; [Watching him closely.] And George Tesman&mdash;after
      all, you must admit that he is correctness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      His correctness and respectability are beyond all question.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I don't see anything absolutely ridiculous about him.&mdash;Do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ridiculous? N&mdash;no&mdash;I shouldn't exactly say so&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;and his powers of research, at all events, are untiring.&mdash;I
      see no reason why he should not one day come to the front, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at her hesitatingly.] I thought that you, like every one else,
      expected him to attain the highest distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With an expression of fatigue.] Yes, so I did.&mdash;And then, since he
      was bent, at all hazards, on being allowed to provide for me&mdash;I
      really don't know why I should not have accepted his offer?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;if you look at it in that light&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than my other adorers were prepared to do for me, my dear
      Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing.] Well, I can't answer for all the rest; but as for myself, you
      know quite well that I have always entertained a&mdash;a certain respect
      for the marriage tie&mdash;for marriage as an institution, Mrs. Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Jestingly.] Oh, I assure you I have never cherished any hopes with
      respect to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      All I require is a pleasant and intimate interior, where I can make myself
      useful in every way, and am free to come and go as&mdash;as a trusted
      friend&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the master of the house, do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bowing.] Frankly&mdash;of the mistress first of all; but of course of the
      master too, in the second place. Such a triangular friendship&mdash;if I
      may call it so&mdash;is really a great convenience for all the parties,
      let me tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I have many a time longed for some one to make a third on our
      travels. Oh&mdash;those railway-carriage <i>tete-a-tetes</i>&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately your wedding journey is over now.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shaking her head.] Not by a long&mdash;long way. I have only arrived at a
      station on the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then the passengers jump out and move about a little, Mrs. Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never jump out.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;because there is always some one standing by to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing.] To look at your ankles, do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well but, dear me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With a gesture of repulsion.] I won't have it. I would rather keep my
      seat where I happen to be&mdash;and continue the <i>tete-a-tete</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suppose a third person were to jump in and join the couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah&mdash;that is quite another matter!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trusted, sympathetic friend&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;with a fund of conversation on all sorts of lively topics&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;and not the least bit of a specialist!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With an audible sigh.] Yes, that would be a relief indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Hears the front door open, and glances in that direction.] The triangle
      is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Half aloud.] And on goes the train.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  GEORGE TESMAN, in a grey walking-suit, with a soft felt hat,
  enters from the hall.  He has a number of unbound books under
  his arm and in his pockets.
</pre>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Goes up to the table beside the corner settee.] Ouf&mdash;what a load for
      a warm day&mdash;all these books. [Lays them on the table.] I'm positively
      perspiring, Hedda. Hallo&mdash;are you there already, my dear Judge? Eh?
      Berta didn't tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising.] I came in through the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What books have you got there?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stands looking them through.] Some new books on my special subjects
      &mdash;quite indispensable to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your special subjects?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, books on his special subjects, Mrs. Tesman.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [BRACK and HEDDA exchange a confidential smile.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you need still more books on your special subjects?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, my dear Hedda, one can never have too many of them. Of course one
      must keep up with all that is written and published.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I suppose one must.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Searching among his books.] And look here&mdash;I have got hold of Eilert
      Lovborg's new book too. [Offering it to her.] Perhaps you would like to
      glance through it, Hedda? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, thank you. Or rather&mdash;afterwards perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked into it a little on the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what do you think of it&mdash;as a specialist?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it shows quite remarkable soundness of judgment. He never wrote
      like that before. [Putting the books together.] Now I shall take all these
      into my study. I'm longing to cut the leaves&mdash;! And then I must
      change my clothes. [To BRACK.] I suppose we needn't start just yet? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, dear no&mdash;there is not the slightest hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, I will take my time. [Is going with his books, but stops in the
      doorway and turns.] By-the-bye, Hedda&mdash;Aunt Julia is not coming this
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not coming? Is it that affair of the bonnet that keeps her away?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, not at all. How could you think such a thing of Aunt Julia? Just fancy&mdash;!
      The fact is, Aunt Rina is very ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      She always is.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but to-day she is much worse than usual, poor dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, then it's only natural that her sister should remain with her. I must
      bear my disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you can't imagine, dear, how delighted Aunt Julia seemed to be&mdash;
      because you had come home looking so flourishing!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Half aloud, rising.] Oh, those everlasting Aunts!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      What?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Going to the glass door.] Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, all right. [He goes through the inner room, out to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      What bonnet were you talking about?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it was a little episode with Miss Tesman this morning. She had laid
      down her bonnet on the chair there&mdash;[Looks at him and smiles.]&mdash;and
      I pretended to think it was the servant's.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shaking his head.] Now my dear Mrs. Hedda, how could you do such a thing?
      To the excellent old lady, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nervously crossing the room.] Well, you see&mdash;these impulses come
      over me all of a sudden; and I cannot resist them. [Throws herself down in
      the easy-chair by the stove.] Oh, I don't know how to explain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Behind the easy-chair.] You are not really happy&mdash;that is at the
      bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking straight before her.] I know of no reason why I should be&mdash;
      happy. Perhaps you can give me one?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well-amongst other things, because you have got exactly the home you had
      set your heart on.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks up at him and laughs.] Do you too believe in that legend?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there nothing in it, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, there is something in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is this in it, that I made use of Tesman to see me home from evening
      parties last summer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, unfortunately, had to go quite a different way.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's true. I know you were going a different way last summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing.] Oh fie, Mrs. Hedda! Well, then&mdash;you and Tesman&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we happened to pass here one evening; Tesman, poor fellow, was
      writhing in the agony of having to find conversation; so I took pity on
      the learned man&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiles doubtfully.] You took pity? H'm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I really did. And so&mdash;to help him out of his torment&mdash;I
      happened to say, in pure thoughtlessness, that I should like to live in
      this villa.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more than that?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      But afterwards?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, my thoughtlessness had consequences, my dear Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately that too often happens, Mrs. Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks! So you see it was this enthusiasm for Secretary Falk's villa that
      first constituted a bond of sympathy between George Tesman and me. From
      that came our engagement and our marriage, and our wedding journey, and
      all the rest of it. Well, well, my dear Judge&mdash;as you make your bed
      so you must lie, I could almost say.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is exquisite! And you really cared not a rap about it all the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, heaven knows I didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now? Now that we have made it so homelike for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uh&mdash;the rooms all seem to smell of lavender and dried rose-leaves.&mdash;But
      perhaps it's Aunt Julia that has brought that scent with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing.] No, I think it must be a legacy from the late Mrs. Secretary
      Falk.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there is an odour of mortality about it. It reminds me of a bouquet&mdash;the
      day after the ball. [Clasps her hands behind her head, leans back in her
      chair and looks at him.] Oh, my dear Judge&mdash;you cannot imagine how
      horribly I shall bore myself here.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should not you, too, find some sort of vocation in life, Mrs. Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vocation&mdash;that should attract me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      If possible, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven knows what sort of a vocation that could be. I often wonder whether&mdash;
      [Breaking off.] But that would never do either.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can tell? Let me hear what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether I might not get Tesman to go into politics, I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing.] Tesman? No really now, political life is not the thing for him&mdash;not
      at all in his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I daresay not.&mdash;But if I could get him into it all the same?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why&mdash;what satisfaction could you find in that? If he is not fitted
      for that sort of thing, why should you want to drive him into it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I am bored, I tell you! [After a pause.] So you think it quite out
      of the question that Tesman should ever get into the ministry?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      H'm&mdash;you see, my dear Mrs. Hedda&mdash;to get into the ministry, he
      would have to be a tolerably rich man.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising impatiently.] Yes, there we have it! It is this genteel poverty I
      have managed to drop into&mdash;! [Crosses the room.] That is what makes
      life so pitiable! So utterly ludicrous!&mdash;For that's what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now <i>I</i> should say the fault lay elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have never gone through any really stimulating experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything serious, you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, you may call it so. But now you may perhaps have one in store.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Tossing her head.] Oh, you're thinking of the annoyances about this
      wretched professorship! But that must be Tesman's own affair. I assure you
      I shall not waste a thought upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, I daresay not. But suppose now that what people call&mdash;in
      elegant language&mdash;a solemn responsibility were to come upon you?
      [Smiling.] A new responsibility, Mrs. Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Angrily.] Be quiet! Nothing of that sort will ever happen!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Warily.] We will speak of this again a year hence&mdash;at the very
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Curtly.] I have no turn for anything of the sort, Judge Brack. No
      responsibilities for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you so unlike the generality of women as to have no turn for duties
      which&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Beside the glass door.] Oh, be quiet, I tell you!&mdash;I often think
      there is only one thing in the world I have any turn for.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Drawing near to her.] And what is that, if I may ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stands looking out.] Boring myself to death. Now you know it. [Turns,
      looks towards the inner room, and laughs.] Yes, as I thought! Here comes
      the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Softly, in a tone of warning.] Come, come, come, Mrs. Hedda!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  GEORGE TESMAN, dressed for the party, with his gloves and hat
  in his hand, enters from the right through the inner room.
</pre>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedda, has no message come from Eilert Lovborg? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you'll see he'll be here presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you really think he will come?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I am almost sure of it. For what you were telling us this morning
      must have been a mere floating rumour.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      You think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, Aunt Julia said she did not believe for a moment that he
      would ever stand in my way again. Fancy that!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, that's all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Placing his hat and gloves on a chair on the right.] Yes, but you must
      really let me wait for him as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have plenty of time yet. None of my guests will arrive before seven or
      half-past.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then meanwhile we can keep Hedda company, and see what happens. Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Placing BRACK'S hat and overcoat upon the corner settee.] And at the
      worst Mr. Lovborg can remain here with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Offering to take his things.] Oh, allow me, Mrs. Tesman!&mdash;What do
      you mean by "At the worst"?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he won't go with you and Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks dubiously at her.] But, Hedda dear&mdash;do you think it would
      quite do for him to remain here with you? Eh? Remember, Aunt Julia can't
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, but Mrs. Elvsted is coming. We three can have a cup of tea together.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, that will be all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiling.] And that would perhaps be the safest plan for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you know, Mrs. Tesman, how you used to gird at my little bachelor
      parties. You declared they were adapted only for men of the strictest
      principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no doubt Mr. Lovborg's principles are strict enough now. A converted
      sinner&mdash; [BERTA appears at the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a gentleman asking if you are at home, ma'am&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, show him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Softly.] I'm sure it is he! Fancy that!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  EILERT LOVBORG enters from the hall.  He is slim and lean;
  of the same age as TESMAN, but looks older and somewhat
  worn-out.  His hair and beard are of a blackish brown, his
  face long and pale, but with patches of colour on the cheeks.
  He is dressed in a well-cut black visiting suit, quite new.
  He has dark gloves and a silk hat.  He stops near the door,
  and makes a rapid bow, seeming somewhat embarrassed.
</pre>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Goes up to him and shakes him warmly by the hand.] Well, my dear Eilert&mdash;so
      at last we meet again!
    </p>
    <p>
      EILERT LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Speaks in a subdued voice.] Thanks for your letter, Tesman. [Approaching
      HEDDA.] Will you too shake hands with me, Mrs. Tesman?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Taking his hand.] I am glad to see you, Mr. Lovborg. [With a motion of
      her hand.] I don't know whether you two gentlemen&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bowing slightly.] Judge Brack, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Doing likewise.] Oh yes,&mdash;in the old days&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [To LOVBORG, with his hands on his shoulders.] And now you must make
      yourself entirely at home, Eilert! Mustn't he, Hedda?&mdash;For I hear you
      are going to settle in town again? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite right, quite right. Let me tell you, I have got hold of your new
      book; but I haven't had time to read it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may spare yourself the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why so?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because there is very little in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just fancy&mdash;how can you say so?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it has been very much praised, I hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what I wanted; so I put nothing into the book but what every one
      would agree with.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very wise of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well but, my dear Eilert&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now I mean to win myself a position again&mdash;to make a fresh start.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A little embarrassed.] Ah, that is what you wish to do? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiling, lays down his hat, and draws a packet wrapped in paper, from his
      coat pocket.] But when this one appears, George Tesman, you will have to
      read it. For this is the real book&mdash;the book I have put my true self
      into.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed? And what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the continuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      The continuation? Of what?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the new book?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, my dear Eilert&mdash;does it not come down to our own days?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it does; and this one deals with the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the future! But, good heavens, we know nothing of the future!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; but there is a thing or two to be said about it all the same. [Opens
      the packet.] Look here&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, that's not your handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dictated it. [Turning over the pages.] It falls into two sections. The
      first deals with the civilising forces of the future. And here is the
      second&mdash;[running through the pages towards the end]&mdash;forecasting
      the probable line of development.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      How odd now! I should never have thought of writing anything of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At the glass door, drumming on the pane.] H'm&mdash;. I daresay not.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Replacing the manuscript in its paper and laying the packet on the
      table.] I brought it, thinking I might read you a little of it this
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was very good of you, Eilert. But this evening&mdash;? [Looking back
      at BRACK.] I don't see how we can manage it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, some other time. There is no hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must tell you, Mr. Lovborg&mdash;there is a little gathering at my house
      this evening&mdash;mainly in honour of Tesman, you know&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking for his hat.] Oh&mdash;then I won't detain you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, but listen&mdash;will you not do me the favour of joining us?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Curtly and decidedly.] No, I can't&mdash;thank you very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, nonsense&mdash;do! We shall be quite a select little circle. And I
      assure you we shall have a "lively time," as Mrs. Hed&mdash;as Mrs. Tesman
      says.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no doubt of it. But nevertheless&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then you might bring your manuscript with you, and read it to Tesman
      at my house. I could give you a room to yourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, think of that, Eilert,&mdash;why shouldn't you? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Interposing.] But, Tesman, if Mr. Lovborg would really rather not! I am
      sure Mr. Lovborg is much more inclined to remain here and have supper with
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking at her.] With you, Mrs. Tesman?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with Mrs. Elvsted.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah&mdash; [Lightly.] I saw her for a moment this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you? Well, she is coming this evening. So you see you are almost bound
      to remain, Mr. Lovborg, or she will have no one to see her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's true. Many thanks, Mrs. Tesman&mdash;in that case I will remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I have one or two orders to give the servant&mdash;

       to her in a whisper, and points towards the inner room.  BERTA

      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At the same time, to LOVBORG.] Tell me, Eilert&mdash;is it this new
      subject&mdash;the future&mdash;that you are going to lecture about?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.

    <p>
      Yes.

      They told me at the bookseller's that you are going to deliver a course of
      lectures this autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is my intention. I hope you won't take it ill, Tesman.

      TESMAN.

      with me? Eh?

      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; it is only the moral victory I care for.

    <p>
      HEDDA.

    <p>
      [Apparently absorbed in the album.] If you continue to say <i>du</i> to me
      I won't talk to you.

      May I not say <i>du</i> even when we are alone?

    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. You may think it; but you mustn't say it.

      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, I understand. It is an offence against George Tesman, whom you<a

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      TESMAN.

    <p>
      Here you are! Isn't this tempting? [He puts the tray on the table.

    <p>
      TESMAN.

    <p>
      [Filling the glasses.] Because I think it's such fun to wait upon you,
      Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you have poured out two glasses. Mr. Lovborg said he wouldn't have any&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, but Mrs. Elvsted will soon be here, won't she?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, by-the-bye&mdash;Mrs. Elvsted&mdash;

      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had you forgotten her? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were so absorbed in these photographs. [Shows him a picture.] Do you
      remember this little village?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it's that one just below the Brenner Pass. It was there we passed the
      night&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;and met that lively party of tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was the place. Fancy&mdash;if we could only have had you with
      us, Eilert! Eh?

      Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there no love in your friendship for me either? Not a spark&mdash;not
      a tinge of love in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder if there was? To me it seems as though we were two good comrades&mdash;two
      thoroughly intimate friends. [Smilingly.] You especially were frankness
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was you that made me so.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I look back upon it all, I think there was really something beautiful,
      something fascinating&mdash;something daring&mdash;in&mdash;in that secret
      intimacy&mdash;that comradeship which no living creature so much as
      dreamed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, Hedda! Was there not?&mdash;When I used to come to your father's
      in the afternoon&mdash;and the General sat over at the window reading his
      papers&mdash;with his back towards us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.

      For want of an album, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Hedda, and when I made my confessions to you&mdash;told you about
      myself, things that at that time no one else knew! There I would sit and
      tell you of my escapades&mdash;my days and nights of devilment. Oh, Hedda&mdash;what
      was the power in you that forced me to confess these things?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.

      you used to put to me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which you understood so particularly well&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could you sit and question me like that? Question me quite frankly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      In roundabout terms, please observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but frankly nevertheless. Cross-question me about&mdash;all that sort
      of thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.

    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that is just what I can't understand&mdash;in looking back upon it.
      But tell me now, Hedda&mdash;was there not love at the bottom of our
      friendship? On your side, did you not feel as though you might purge my
      stains away&mdash;if I made you my confessor? Was it not so?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not quite.

      Which&mdash;?

    </p>
    <p>
      Partly. Partly&mdash;I almost think.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comradeship in the thirst for life. But why should not that, at any rate,
      have continued?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fault was yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was you that broke with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, when our friendship threatened to develop into something more
      serious. Shame upon you, Eilert Lovborg! How could you think of wronging
      your&mdash;your frank comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Clenches his hands.] Oh, why did you not carry out your threat? Why did
      you not shoot me down?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I have such a dread of scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Hedda, you are a coward at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      A terrible coward. [Changing her tone.] But it was a lucky thing for you.
      And now you have found ample consolation at the Elvsteds'.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.

      I know what Thea has confided to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps you have confided to her something about us?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word. She is too stupid to understand anything of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stupid?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is stupid about matters of that sort.
    </p>

      HEDDA.
    </p>

      And I am cowardly. [Bends over towards him, without looking him in the
      face, and says more softly:] But now I will confide something to you.

      comradeship! You<a name="H11a" id="H11a"></a>(<a href="#link11">11</a>)

    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      His contemptuous smile, when you dared not go with them into the inner
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dared not? Of course I preferred to stop here and talk to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could be more natural, Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Judge could not guess that. And I say, too, the way he smiled and
      glanced at Tesman when you dared not accept his invitation to this
      wretched little supper-party of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dared not! Do you say I dared not?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I</i> don't say so. But that was how Judge Brack understood it.

    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, let him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.

    <p>
      Then you are not going with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will stay here with you and Thea.
    </p>

      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Hedda&mdash;how can you doubt that?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiles and nods approvingly to LOVBORG.] Firm as a rock! Faithful to your
      principles, now and for ever! Ah, that is how a man should be! [Turns to
      MRS. ELVSTED and caresses her.] Well now, what did I tell you, when you
      came to us this morning in such a state of distraction&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Surprised.] Distraction!

    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see for yourself! You haven't the slightest reason to be in such
      mortal terror&mdash; [Interrupting herself.] There! Now we can all three
      enjoy ourselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Who has given a start.] Ah&mdash;what is all this, Mrs. Tesman?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh my God, Hedda! What are you saying? What are you doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't get excited! That horrid Judge Brack is sitting watching you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was in mortal terror! On my account!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Softly and piteously.] Oh, Hedda&mdash;now you have ruined everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks fixedly at her for a moment. His face is distorted.] So that was my

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it arranged between you and him that you were to come to town and look
      after me? Perhaps it was the Sheriff himself that urged you to come? Aha,
      my dear&mdash;no doubt he wanted my help in his office! Or was it at the
      card-table that he missed me?

  The room at the TESMANS'.  The curtains are drawn over the
  middle doorway, and also over the glass door.  The lamp,
  half turned down, and with a shade over it, is burning on
  the table.  In the stove, the door of which stands open,
  there has been a fire, which is now nearly burnt out.

  MRS. ELVSTED, wrapped in a large shawl, and with her feet

      erect upon the sofa, stretches herself, and rubs her eyes.] What o'clock
      is it, Thea?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at her watch.] It's past seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      When did Tesman come home?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not come home yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising.] No one has come.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of our watching and waiting here till four in the morning&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Wringing her hands.] And how I watched and waited for him!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Yawns, and says with her hand before her mouth.] Well well&mdash;we might
      have spared ourselves the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you get a little sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes; I believe I have slept pretty well. Have you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for a moment. I couldn't, Hedda!&mdash;not to save my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rises and goes towards her.] There there there! There's nothing to be so
      alarmed about. I understand quite well what has happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what do you think? Won't you tell me?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, of course it has been a very late affair at Judge Brack's&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes&mdash;that is clear enough. But all the same&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, you see, Tesman hasn't cared to come home and ring us up in the
      middle of the night. [Laughing.] Perhaps he wasn't inclined to show
      himself either&mdash;immediately after a jollification.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in that case&mdash;where can he have gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he has gone to his Aunts' and slept there. They have his old
      room ready for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he can't be with them for a letter has just come for him from Miss
      Tesman. There it lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed? [Looks at the address.] Why yes, it's addressed in Aunt Julia's
      hand. Well then, he has remained at Judge Brack's. And as for Eilert
      Lovborg&mdash;he is sitting, with vine-leaves in his hair, reading his
      manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Hedda, you are just saying things you don't believe a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You really are a little blockhead, Thea.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, I suppose I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how mortally tired you look.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I am mortally tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, you must do as I tell you. You must go into my room and lie
      down for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh no, no&mdash;I shouldn't be able to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure you would.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, but you husband is certain to come soon now; and then I want to know
      at once&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall take care to let you know when he comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you promise me, Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, rely upon me. Just you go in and have a sleep in the meantime.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks; then I'll try. [She goes off to the inner room.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [HEDDA goes up to the glass door and draws back the curtains.
       The broad daylight streams into the room.  Then she takes a
       little hand-glass from the writing-table, looks at herself
       in it, and arranges her hair.  Next she goes to the hall
       door and presses the bell-button.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  BERTA presently appears at the hall door.
</pre>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you want anything, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; you must put some more wood in the stove. I am shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bless me&mdash;I'll make up the fire at once. [She rakes the embers
      together and lays a piece of wood upon them; then stops and listens.] That
      was a ring at the front door, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then go to the door. I will look after the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      It'll soon burn up. [She goes out by the hall door.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [HEDDA kneels on the foot-rest and lays some more pieces of
       wood in the stove.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   After a short pause, GEORGE TESMAN enters from the hall.  He
   steals on tiptoe towards the middle doorway and is about to
   slip through the curtains.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At the stove, without looking up.] Good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Turns.] Hedda! [Approaching her.] Good heavens&mdash;are you up so early?
      Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I am up very early this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I never doubted you were still sound asleep! Fancy that, Hedda!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't speak so loud. Mrs. Elvsted is resting in my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Has Mrs. Elvsted been here all night?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, since no one came to fetch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Closes the door of the stove and rises.] Well, did you enjoy yourselves
      at Judge Brack's?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you been anxious about me? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I should never think of being anxious. But I asked if you had enjoyed
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes,&mdash;for once in a way. Especially the beginning of the evening;
      for then Eilert read me part of his book. We arrived more than an hour too
      early&mdash;fancy that! And Brack had all sorts of arrangements to make&mdash;so
      Eilert read to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Seating herself by the table on the right.] Well? Tell me then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Sitting on a footstool near the stove.] Oh, Hedda, you can't conceive
      what a book that is going to be! I believe it is one of the most
      remarkable things that have ever been written. Fancy that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes yes; I don't care about that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must make a confession to you, Hedda. When he had finished reading&mdash;a
      horrid feeling came over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horrid feeling?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt jealous of Eilert for having had it in him to write such a book.
      Only think, Hedda!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, I am thinking!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then how pitiful to think that he&mdash;with all his gifts&mdash;should
      be irreclaimable, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose you mean that he has more courage than the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not at all&mdash;I mean that he is incapable of taking his pleasure in
      moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what came of it all&mdash;in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, to tell the truth, I think it might best be described as an orgie,
      Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he vine-leaves in his hair?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vine-leaves? No, I saw nothing of the sort. But he made a long, rambling
      speech in honour of the woman who had inspired him in his work&mdash;that
      was the phrase he used.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he name her?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he didn't; but I can't help thinking he meant Mrs. Elvsted. You may be
      sure he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;where did you part from him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way to town. We broke up&mdash;the last of us at any rate&mdash;all
      together; and Brack came with us to get a breath of fresh air. And then,
      you see, we agreed to take Eilert home; for he had had far more than was
      good for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I daresay.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now comes the strange part of it, Hedda; or, I should rather say, the
      melancholy part of it. I declare I am almost ashamed&mdash;on Eilert's
      account&mdash;to tell you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, go on&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, as we were getting near town, you see, I happened to drop a little
      behind the others. Only for a minute or two&mdash;fancy that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes yes yes, but&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as I hurried after them&mdash;what do you think I found by the
      wayside? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how should I know!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      You mustn't speak of it to a soul, Hedda! Do you hear! Promise me, for
      Eilert's sake. [Draws a parcel, wrapped in paper, from his coat pocket.]
      Fancy, dear&mdash;I found this.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is not that the parcel he had with him yesterday?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it is the whole of his precious, irreplaceable manuscript! And he had
      gone and lost it, and knew nothing about it. Only fancy, Hedda! So
      deplorably&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why did you not give him back the parcel at once?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't dare to&mdash;in the state he was then in&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you not tell any of the others that you had found it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, far from it! You can surely understand that, for Eilert's sake, I
      wouldn't do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      So no one knows that Eilert Lovborg's manuscript is in your possession?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. And no one must know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then what did you say to him afterwards?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't talk to him again at all; for when we got in among the streets,
      he and two or three of the others gave us the slip and disappeared. Fancy
      that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed! They must have taken him home then.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, so it would appear. And Brack, too, left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what have you been doing with yourself since?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I and some of the others went home with one of the party, a jolly
      fellow, and took our morning coffee with him; or perhaps I should rather
      call it our night coffee&mdash;eh? But now, when I have rested a little,
      and given Eilert, poor fellow, time to have his sleep out, I must take
      this back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Holds out her hand for the packet.] No&mdash;don't give it to him! Not in
      such a hurry, I mean. Let me read it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, my dearest Hedda, I mustn't, I really mustn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;for you can imagine what a state of despair he will be in when he
      wakens and misses the manuscript. He has no copy of it, you must know! He
      told me so.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking searchingly at him.] Can such a thing not be reproduced? Written
      over again?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I don't think that would be possible. For the inspiration, you see&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes&mdash;I suppose it depends on that&mdash;[Lightly.] But,
      by-the-bye &mdash;here is a letter for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Handing it to him.] It came early this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's from Aunt Julia! What can it be? [He lays the packet on the other
      footstool, opens the letter, runs his eye through it, and jumps up.] Oh,
      Hedda&mdash;she says that poor Aunt Rina is dying!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we were prepared for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that if I want to see her again, I must make haste. I'll run in to
      them at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Suppressing a smile.] Will you run?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, my dearest Hedda&mdash;if you could only make up your mind to come
      with me! Just think!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rises and says wearily, repelling the idea.] No, no don't ask me. I will
      not look upon sickness and death. I loathe all sorts of ugliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well, then&mdash;! [Bustling around.] My hat&mdash;? My overcoat&mdash;?
      Oh, in the hall&mdash;. I do hope I mayn't come too late, Hedda! Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if you run&mdash; [BERTA appears at the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      BERTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Brack is at the door, and wishes to know if he may come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time! No, I can't possibly see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I can. [To BERTA.] Ask Judge Brack to come in. [BERTA goes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Quickly, whispering.] The parcel, Tesman!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [She snatches it up from the stool.

    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, give it to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, I will keep it till you come back.

      HEDDA.

    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, don't you think so! [To TESMAN.] Are you on the move, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I must rush of to my aunts'. Fancy&mdash;the invalid one is lying at
      death's door, poor creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear me, is she indeed? Then on no account let me detain you. At such a
      critical moment&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Approaching.] You seem to have made a particularly lively night of it at
      your rooms, Judge Brack.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assure you I have not had my clothes off, Mrs. Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not you, either?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, as you may see. But what has Tesman been telling you of the night's
      adventures?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, some tiresome story. Only that they went and had coffee somewhere or
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard about that coffee-party already. Eilert Lovborg was not with
      them, I fancy?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, they had taken him home before that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tesman too?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, but some of the others, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiling.] George Tesman is really an ingenuous creature, Mrs. Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, heaven knows he is. Then is there something behind all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, perhaps there may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, sit down, my dear Judge, and tell your story in comfort.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [She seats herself to the left of the table.  BRACK sits near
       her, at the long side of the table.

    </p>
    <p>
      Now then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had special reasons for keeping track of my guests&mdash;last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Eilert Lovborg among the rest, perhaps?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankly, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you make me really curious&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know where he and one or two of the others finished the night, Mrs.
      Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is not quite unmentionable, tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh no, it's not at all unmentionable. Well, they put in an appearance at a
      particularly animated soiree.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the lively kind?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the very liveliest&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell me more of this, Judge Brack&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovborg, as well as the others, had been invited in advance. I knew all
      about it. But he had declined the invitation; for now, as you know, he has
      become a new man.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up at the Elvsteds', yes. But he went after all, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you see, Mrs. Hedda&mdash;unhappily the spirit moved him at my rooms
      last evening&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I hear he found inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty violent inspiration. Well, I fancy that altered his purpose; for we
      menfolk are unfortunately not always so firm in our principles as we ought
      to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I am sure you are an exception, Judge Brack. But as to Lovborg&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a long story short&mdash;he landed at last in Mademoiselle Diana's
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Diana's?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mademoiselle Diana that was giving the soiree, to a select circle
      of her admirers and her lady friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is she a red-haired woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of a&mdash;singer?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes&mdash;in her leisure moments. And moreover a mighty huntress&mdash;of
      men&mdash;Mrs. Hedda. You have no doubt heard of her. Eilert Lovborg was
      one of her most enthusiastic protectors&mdash;in the days of his glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how did all this end?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from amicably, it appears. After a most tender meeting, they seem to
      have come to blows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovborg and she?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. He accused her or her friends of having robbed him. He declared that
      his pocket-book had disappeared&mdash;and other things as well. In short,
      he seems to have made a furious disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what came of it all?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to a general scrimmage, in which the ladies as well as the
      gentlemen took part. Fortunately the police at last appeared on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police too?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. I fancy it will prove a costly frolic for Eilert Lovborg, crazy being
      that he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      How so?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seems to have made a violent resistance&mdash;to have hit one of the
      constables on the head and torn the coat off his back. So they had to
      march him off to the police-station with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      How have you learnt all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the police themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Gazing straight before her.] So that is what happened. Then he had no
      vine-leaves in his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vine-leaves, Mrs. Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Changing her tone.] But tell me now, Judge&mdash;what is your real reason
      for tracking out Eilert Lovborg's movements so carefully?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, it could not be entirely indifferent to me if it
      should appear in the police-court that he came straight from my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will the matter come into court then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course. However, I should scarcely have troubled so much about that.
      But I thought that, as a friend of the family, it was my duty to supply
      you and Tesman with a full account of his nocturnal exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why so, Judge Brack?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, because I have a shrewd suspicion that he intends to use you as a
      sort of blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how can you think such a thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good heavens, Mrs. Hedda&mdash;we have eyes in our head. Mark my words!
      This Mrs. Elvsted will be in no hurry to leave town again.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, even if there should be anything between them, I suppose there are
      plenty of other places where they could meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a single home. Henceforth, as before, every respectable house will be
      closed against Eilert Lovborg.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so ought mine to be, you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. I confess it would be more than painful to me if this personage were
      to be made free of your house. How superfluous, how intrusive, he would
      be, if he were to force his way into&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;into the triangle?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precisely. It would simply mean that I should find myself homeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at him with a smile.] So you want to be the one cock in the basket<a
      name="H12a" id="H12a"></a>(<a href="#link12">12</a>)&mdash;that is
      your aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Nods slowly and lowers his voice.] Yes, that is my aim. And for that I
      will fight&mdash;with every weapon I can command.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Her smile vanishing.] I see you are a dangerous person&mdash;when it
      comes to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am beginning to think so. And I am exceedingly glad to think&mdash;that
      you have no sort of hold over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing equivocally.] Well well, Mrs. Hedda&mdash;perhaps you are right
      there. If I had, who knows what I might be capable of?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come come now, Judge Brack! That sounds almost like a threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising.] Oh, not at all! The triangle, you know, ought, if possible, to
      be spontaneously constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      There I agree with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now I have said all I had to say; and I had better be getting back
      to town. Good-bye, Mrs. Hedda. [He goes towards the glass door.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Rising.] Are you going through the garden?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it's a short cut for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it is a back way, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite so. I have no objection to back ways. They may be piquant enough at
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      When there is ball practice going on, you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In the doorway, laughing to her.] Oh, people don't shoot their tame
      poultry, I fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Also laughing.] Oh no, when there is only one cock in the basket&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [They exchange laughing nods of farewell.  He goes.  She closes
       the door behind him.

     [HEDDA, who has become quite serious, stands for a moment
       looking out.  Presently she goes and peeps through the
       curtain over the middle doorway.  Then she goes to the
       writing-table, takes LOVBORG'S packet out of the bookcase,
       and is on the point of looking through its contents.  BERTA
       is heard speaking loudly in the hall.  HEDDA turns and
       listens.  Then she hastily locks up the packet in the drawer,
       and lays the key on the inkstand.

      [At the writing-table.] Well, Mr Lovborg, this is rather a late hour to
      call for Thea.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      You mean rather an early hour to call on you. Pray pardon me.

    <p>
      [Going to the oval table.] Did you notice anything about the people of the
      house when they said that?

    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks inquiringly at her.] Notice anything about them?

    <p>
      [Suddenly understanding.] Oh yes, of course! I am dragging her down with

      Nothing more?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.

    <p>
      I don't think so. However, I was so dreadfully sleepy&mdash;

    MRS. ELVSTED enters through the curtains of the middle doorway.

    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.

    <p>
      [Going towards him.] Ah, Lovborg! At last&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, at last. And too late!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks anxiously at him.] What is too late?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything is too late now. It is all over with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh no, no&mdash;don't say that!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will say the same when you hear&mdash;

    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      I won't hear anything!

    <p>
      HEDDA.

      Perhaps you would prefer to talk to her alone? If so, I will leave you.

      Yes, but I won't hear anything, I tell you.

    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not last night's adventures that I want to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it then&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to say that now our ways must part.
    </p>

      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part!
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      You can be of no more service to me, Thea.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can you stand there and say that! No more service to you! Am I not to
      help you now, as before? Are we not to go on working together?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforward I shall do no work.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Despairingly.] Then what am I to do with my life?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must try to live your life as if you had never know me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you know I cannot do that!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try if you cannot, Thea. You must go home again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In vehement protest.] Never in this world! Where you are, there will I be
      also! I will not let myself be driven away like this! I will remain here!
      I will be with you when the book appears.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Half aloud, in suspense.] Ah yes&mdash;the book!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at her.] My book and Thea's; for that is what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I feel that it is. And that is why I have a right to be with you when
      it appears! I will see with my own eyes how respect and honour pour in
      upon you afresh. And the happiness&mdash;the happiness&mdash;oh, I must
      share it with you!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thea&mdash;our book will never appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never appear!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can never appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In agonised foreboding.] Lovborg&mdash;what have you done with the
      manuscript?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks anxiously at him.] Yes, the manuscript&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manuscript&mdash;. Well then&mdash;I have torn the manuscript into a
      thousand pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shrieks.] Oh no, no&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Involuntarily.] But that's not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks at her.] Not true, you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Collecting herself.] Oh well, of course&mdash;since you say so. But it
      sounded so improbable&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Wringing her hands.] Oh God&mdash;oh God, Hedda&mdash;torn his own work
      to pieces!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have torn my own life to pieces. So why should I not tear my life-work
      too&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you did this last night?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I tell you! Tore it into a thousand pieces&mdash;and scattered them
      on the fiord&mdash;far out. There there is cool sea-water at any rate&mdash;let
      them drift upon it&mdash;drift with the current and the wind. And then
      presently they will sink&mdash;deeper and deeper&mdash;as I shall, Thea.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know, Lovborg, that what you have done with the book&mdash;I shall
      think of it to my dying day as though you had killed a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, you are right. It is a sort of child-murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could you, then&mdash;! Did not the child belong to me too?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Almost inaudibly.] Ah, the child&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Breathing heavily.] It is all over then. Well well, now I will go, Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you are not going away from town?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I don't know what I shall do. I see nothing but darkness before me.
      [She goes out by the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Stands waiting for a moment.] So you are not going to see her home, Mr.
      Lovborg?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      I? Through the streets? Would you have people see her walking with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I don't know what else may have happened last night. But is it
      so utterly irretrievable?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will not end with last night&mdash;I know that perfectly well. And the
      thing is that now I have no taste for that sort of life either. I won't
      begin it anew. She has broken my courage and my power of braving life out.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking straight before her.] So that pretty little fool has had her
      fingers in a man's destiny. [Looks at him.] But all the same, how could
      you treat her so heartlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, don't say that I was heartless!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go and destroy what has filled her whole soul for months and years! You
      do not call that heartless!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      To you I can tell the truth, Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      First promise me&mdash;give me your word&mdash;that what I now confide in
      you Thea shall never know.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I give you my word.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good. Then let me tell you that what I said just now was untrue.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the manuscript?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. I have not torn it to pieces&mdash;nor thrown it into the fiord.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no&mdash;. But&mdash;where is it then?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have destroyed it none the less&mdash;utterly destroyed it, Hedda!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thea said that what I had done seemed to her like a child-murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, so she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to kill his child&mdash;that is not the worst thing a father can do to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the worst?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose now, Hedda, that a man&mdash;in the small hours of the morning&mdash;came
      home to his child's mother after a night of riot and debauchery, and said:
      "Listen&mdash;I have been here and there&mdash;in this place and in that.
      And I have taken our child with&mdash;to this place and to that. And I
      have lost the child&mdash;utterly lost it. The devil knows into what hands
      it may have fallen&mdash;who may have had their clutches on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;but when all is said and done, you know&mdash;this was only a
      book&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thea's pure soul was in that book.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, so I understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you can understand, too, that for her and me together no future is
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What path do you mean to take then?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      None. I will only try to make an end of it all&mdash;the sooner the
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A step nearer him.] Eilert Lovborg&mdash;listen to me.&mdash;Will you not
      try to&mdash;to do it beautifully?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautifully? [Smiling.] With vine-leaves in my hair, as you used to dream
      in the old days&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no. I have lost my faith in the vine-leaves. But beautifully
      nevertheless! For once in a way!&mdash;Good-bye! You must go now&mdash;and
      do not come here any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOVBORG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-bye, Mrs. Tesman. And give George Tesman my love.

       the writing-table, takes out the packet of manuscript, peeps
       under the cover, draws a few of the sheets half out, and
       looks at them.  Next she goes over and seats herself in the

      ACT FOURTH.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The same rooms at the TESMANS'.  It is evening.  The drawing-
  room is in darkness.  The back room is light by the hanging
  lamp over the table.  The curtains over the glass door are
  drawn close.

  HEDDA, dressed in black, walks to and fro in the dark room.
  Then she goes into the back room and disappears for a moment
  to the left.  She is heard to strike a few chords on the
  piano.  Presently she comes in sight again, and returns to
  the drawing-room.

  BERTA enters from the right, through the inner room, with a
  lighted lamp, which she places on the table in front of the
  corner settee in the drawing-room.  Her eyes are red with
  weeping, and she has black ribbons in her cap.  She goes
  quietly and circumspectly out to the right.  HEDDA goes up
  to the glass door, lifts the curtain a little aside, and
  looks out into the darkness.

  Shortly afterwards, MISS TESMAN, in mourning, with a bonnet
  and veil on, comes in from the hall.  HEDDA goes towards her
  and holds out her hand.
</pre>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister has
      at last found peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to Hedda&mdash;here
      in the house of life&mdash;I ought myself to bring the tidings of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was very kind of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
      Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Changing the subject.] She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
      Tesman?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
      happiness of seeing George once more&mdash;and bidding him good-bye.&mdash;Has
      he not come home yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much to
      do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She shall go
      to her grave looking her best.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>

      Can I not help you in any way?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
      mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either&mdash;not at this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      One is not always mistress of one's thoughts&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Continuing.] Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be
      sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose&mdash;but
      of another sort, thank God!

  GEORGE TESMAN enters by the hall door.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, you have come at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      You here, Aunt Julia? With Hedda? Fancy that!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just going, my dear boy. Well, have you done all you promised?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; I'm really afraid I have forgotten half of it. I must come to you
      again to-morrow. To-day my brain is all in a whirl. I can't keep my
      thoughts together.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, my dear George, you mustn't take it in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mustn't&mdash;? How do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in your sorrow you must rejoice, as I do&mdash;rejoice that she is at
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, yes&mdash;you are thinking of Aunt Rina.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will feel lonely now, Miss Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at first, yes. But that will not last very long, I hope. I daresay I
      shall soon find an occupant for Rina's little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed? Who do you think will take it? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, there's always some poor invalid or other in want of nursing,
      unfortunately.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you really take such a burden upon you again?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      A burden! Heaven forgive you, child&mdash;it has been no burden to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suppose you had a total stranger on your hands&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, one soon makes friends with sick folk; and it's such an absolute
      necessity for me to have some one to live for. Well, heaven be praised,
      there may soon be something in this house, too, to keep an old aunt busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, don't trouble about anything here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, just fancy what a nice time we three might have together, if&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      If&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Uneasily.] Oh nothing. It will all come right. Let us hope so&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well well, I daresay you two want to talk to each other. [Smiling.] And
      perhaps Hedda may have something to tell you too, George. Good-bye! I must
      go home to Rina. [Turning at the door.] How strange it is to think that
      now Rina is with me and with my poor brother as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, fancy that, Aunt Julia! Eh?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [MISS TESMAN goes out by the hall door.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Follows TESMAN coldly and searchingly with her eyes.] I almost believe
      your Aunt Rina's death affects you more than it does your Aunt Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it's not that alone. It's Eilert I am so terribly uneasy about.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Quickly.] Is there anything new about him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked in at his rooms this afternoon, intending to tell him the
      manuscript was in safe keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, did you find him?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. He wasn't at home. But afterwards I met Mrs. Elvsted, and she told me
      that he had been here early this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, directly after you had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he said that he had torn his manuscript to pieces&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, so he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, good heavens, he must have been completely out of his mind! And I
      suppose you thought it best not to give it back to him, Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he did not get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of course you told him that we had it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. [Quickly.] Did you tell Mrs. Elvsted?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; I thought I had better not. But you ought to have told him. Fancy, if,
      in desperation, he should go and do himself some injury! Let me have the
      manuscript, Hedda! I will take it to him at once. Where is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Cold and immovable, leaning on the arm-chair.] I have not got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have not got it? What in the world do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have burnt it&mdash;every line of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With a violent movement of terror.] Burnt! Burnt Eilert's manuscript!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't scream so. The servant might hear you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burnt! Why, good God&mdash;! No, no, no! It's impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is so, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know what you have done, Hedda? It's unlawful appropriation of lost
      property. Fancy that! Just ask Judge Brack, and he'll tell you what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advise you not to speak of it&mdash;either to Judge Brack or to anyone
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how could you do anything so unheard-of? What put it into your head?
      What possessed you? Answer me that&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Suppressing an almost imperceptible smile.] I did it for your sake,
      George.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my sake!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, when you told me about what he had read to you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes yes&mdash;what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledged that you envied him his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, of course I didn't mean that literally.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter&mdash;I could not bear the idea that any one should throw you
      into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In an outburst of mingled doubt and joy.] Hedda! Oh, is this true? But&mdash;but&mdash;I
      never knew you show your love like that before. Fancy that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I may as well tell you that&mdash;just at this time&mdash;
      [Impatiently breaking off.] No, no; you can ask Aunt Julia. She well tell
      you, fast enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I almost think I understand you, Hedda! [Clasps his hands together.]
      Great heavens! do you really mean it! Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't shout so. The servant might hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Laughing in irrepressible glee.] The servant! Why, how absurd you are,
      Hedda. It's only my old Berta! Why, I'll tell Berta myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Clenching her hands together in desperation.] Oh, it is killing me,
      &mdash;it is killing me, all this!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is, Hedda? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Coldly, controlling herself.] All this&mdash;absurdity&mdash;George.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absurdity! Do you see anything absurd in my being overjoyed at the news!
      But after all&mdash;perhaps I had better not say anything to Berta.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh&mdash;why not that too?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, not yet! But I must certainly tell Aunt Julia. And then that you
      have begun to call me George too! Fancy that! Oh, Aunt Julia will be so
      happy&mdash;so happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she hears that I have burnt Eilert Lovborg's manuscript&mdash;for
      your sake?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, by-the-bye&mdash;that affair of the manuscript&mdash;of course nobody
      must know about that. But that you love me so much,<a name="H13a"
      id="H13a"></a>(<a href="#link13">13</a>) Hedda&mdash;Aunt Julia must
      really share my joy in that! I wonder, now, whether this sort of thing is
      usual in young wives? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think you had better ask Aunt Julia that question too.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will indeed, some time or other. [Looks uneasy and downcast again.] And
      yet the manuscript&mdash;the manuscript! Good God! it is terrible to think
      what will become of poor Eilert now.

      I heard them talking of him at my boarding-house&mdash;just as I came in.
      Oh, the most incredible rumours are afloat about him to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I couldn't make out anything clearly. Either they knew nothing
      definite, or else&mdash;. They stopped talking when the saw me; and I did
      not dare to ask.

    <p>
      [Shrieks.] Oh God! oh God&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the hospital! And at the point of death!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Involuntarily.] So soon then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Wailing.] And we parted in anger, Hedda!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Whispers.] Thea&mdash;Thea&mdash;be careful!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Not heeding her.] I must go to him! I must see him alive!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless, Madam. No one will be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, at least tell me what has happened to him? What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't mean to say that he has himself&mdash; Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I am sure he has.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Keeping his eyes fixed upon her.] Unfortunately you have guessed quite
      correctly, Mrs. Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how horrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Himself, then! Fancy that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shot himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rightly guessed again, Mrs. Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With an effort at self-control.] When did it happen, Mr. Brack?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon&mdash;between three and four.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, good Lord, where did he do it? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With some hesitation.] Where? Well&mdash;I suppose at his lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that cannot be; for I was there between six and seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, somewhere else. I don't know exactly. I only know that he was
      found&mdash;. He had shot himself&mdash;in the breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how terrible! That he should die like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [To BRACK.] Was it in the breast?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;as I told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in the temple?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the breast, Mrs. Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well&mdash;the breast is a good place, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you mean, Mrs. Tesman?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Evasively.] Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the wound is dangerous, you say&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolutely mortal. The end has probably come by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, I feel it. The end! The end! Oh, Hedda&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      But tell me, how have you learnt all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Curtly.] Through one of the police. A man I had some business with.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In a clear voice.] At last a deed worth doing!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Terrified.] Good heavens, Hedda! what are you saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say there is beauty in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      H'm, Mrs. Tesman&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Hedda, how can you talk of beauty in such an act!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eilert Lovborg has himself made up his account with life. He has had the
      courage to do&mdash;the one right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, you must never think that was how it happened! It must have been in
      delirium that he did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      In despair!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he did not. I am certain of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes! In delirium! Just as when he tore up our manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Starting.] The manuscript? Has he torn that up?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Whispers softly.] Oh, Hedda, we shall never get over this.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      H'm, very extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Moving about the room.] To think of Eilert going out of the world in this
      way! And not leaving behind him the book that would have immortalised his
      name&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if only it could be put together again!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, if it only could! I don't know what I would not give&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it can, Mr. Tesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Searches in the pocket of her dress.] Look here. I have kept all the
      loose notes he used to dictate from.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [A step forward.] Ah&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have kept them, Mrs. Elvsted! Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I have them here. I put them in my pocket when I left home. Here they
      still are&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, do let me see them!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Hands him a bundle of papers.] But they are in such disorder&mdash;all
      mixed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy, if we could make something out of them, after all! Perhaps if we
      two put our heads together&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, at least let us try&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will manage it! We must! I will dedicate my life to this task.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, George? Your life?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, or rather all the time I can spare. My own collections must wait in
      the meantime. Hedda&mdash;you understand, eh? I owe this to Eilert's
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, my dear Mrs. Elvsted, we will give our whole minds to it. There is
      no use in brooding over what can't be undone&mdash;eh? We must try to
      control our grief as much as possible, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, Mr. Tesman, I will do the best I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then, come here. I can't rest until we have looked through the notes.
      Where shall we sit? Here? No, in there, in the back room. Excuse me, my
      dear Judge. Come with me, Mrs. Elvsted.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if only it were possible!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [TESMAN and MRS. ELVSTED go into the back room.  She takes
       off her hat and cloak.  They both sit at the table under the
       hanging lamp, and are soon deep in an eager examination of
       the papers.  HEDDA crosses to the stove and sits in the arm-
       chair.  Presently BRACK goes up to her.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In a low voice.] Oh, what a sense of freedom it gives one, this act of
      Eilert Lovborg's.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freedom, Mrs. Hedda? Well, of course, it is a release for him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean for me. It gives me a sense of freedom to know that a deed of
      deliberate courage is still possible in this world,&mdash;a deed of
      spontaneous beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiling.] H'm&mdash;my dear Mrs. Hedda&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I know what you are going to say. For you are a kind of specialist
      too, like&mdash;you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking hard at her.] Eilert Lovborg was more to you than perhaps you are
      willing to admit to yourself. Am I wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't answer such questions. I only know that Eilert Lovborg has had the
      courage to live his life after his own fashion. And then&mdash;the last
      great act, with its beauty! Ah! that he should have the will and the
      strength to turn away from the banquet of life&mdash;so early.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry, Mrs. Hedda,&mdash;but I fear I must dispel an amiable
      illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Illusion?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which could not have lasted long in any case.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eilert Lovborg did not shoot himself&mdash;voluntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not voluntarily?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. The thing did not happen exactly as I told it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In suspense.] Have you concealed something? What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      For poor Mrs. Elvsted's sake I idealised the facts a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are the facts?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, that he is already dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hospital?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;without regaining consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What more have you concealed?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      This&mdash;the event did not happen at his lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that can make no difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it may. For I must tell you&mdash;Eilert Lovborg was found shot in&mdash;in
      Mademoiselle Diana's boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Makes a motion as if to rise, but sinks back again.] That is impossible,
      Judge Brack! He cannot have been there again to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was there this afternoon. He went there, he said, to demand the return
      of something which they had taken from him. Talked wildly about a lost
      child&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah&mdash;so that is why&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought probably he meant his manuscript; but now I hear he destroyed
      that himself. So I suppose it must have been his pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, no doubt. And there&mdash;there he was found?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there. With a pistol in his breast-pocket, discharged. The ball had
      lodged in a vital part.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the breast&mdash;yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;in the bowels.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks up at him with an expression of loathing.] That too! Oh, what curse
      is it that makes everything I touch turn ludicrous and mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one point more, Mrs. Hedda&mdash;another disagreeable feature in
      the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pistol he carried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Breathless.] Well? What of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have stolen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Leaps up.] Stolen it! That is not true! He did not steal it!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>

      No other explanation is possible. He must have stolen it&mdash;. Hush!

      [Behind Mrs. Elvsted's chair, gently ruffling her hair.] Well, my sweet
      Thea,&mdash;how goes it with Eilert Lovborg's monument?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks dispiritedly up at her.] Oh, it will be terribly hard to put in
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must manage it. I am determined. And arranging other people's papers is
      just the work for me.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [HEDDA goes over to the stove, and seats herself on one of the
       footstools.  BRACK stands over her, leaning on the arm-chair.
</pre>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Whispers.] What did you say about the pistol?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Softly.] That he must have stolen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why stolen it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because every other explanation ought to be impossible, Mrs. Hedda.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Glances at her.] Of course Eilert Lovborg was here this morning. Was he
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were you alone with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you not leave the room whilst he was here?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to recollect. Were you not out of the room a moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, perhaps just a moment&mdash;out in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      And where was you pistol-case during that time?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had it locked up in&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Mrs. Hedda?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case stood there on the writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you looked since, to see whether both the pistols are there?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you need not. I saw the pistol found in Lovborg's pocket, and I knew
      it at once as the one I had seen yesterday&mdash;and before, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you it with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; the police have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      What will the police do with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Search till they find the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you think they will succeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Bends over her and whispers.] No, Hedda Gabler&mdash;not so long as I say
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks frightened at him.] And if you do not say nothing,&mdash;what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shrugs his shoulders.] There is always the possibility that the pistol
      was stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Firmly.] Death rather than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Smiling.] People say such things&mdash;but they don't do them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Without replying.] And supposing the pistol was not stolen, and the owner
      is discovered? What then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Hedda&mdash;then comes the scandal!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scandal!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the scandal&mdash;of which you are so mortally afraid. You will, of
      course, be brought before the court&mdash;both you and Mademoiselle Diana.
      She will have to explain how the thing happened&mdash;whether it was an
      accidental shot or murder. Did the pistol go off as he was trying to take
      it out of his pocket, to threaten her with? Or did she tear the pistol out
      of his hand, shoot him, and push it back into his pocket? That would be
      quite like her; for she is an able-bodied young person, this same
      Mademoiselle Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      But <i>I</i> have nothing to do with all this repulsive business.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. But you will have to answer the question: Why did you give Eilert the
      pistol? And what conclusions will people draw from the fact that you did
      give it to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Lets her head sink.] That is true. I did not think of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, fortunately, there is no danger, so long as I say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks up at him.] So I am in your power, Judge Brack. You have me at your
      beck and call, from this time forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Whispers softly.] Dearest Hedda&mdash;believe me&mdash;I shall not abuse
      my advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am in your power none the less. Subject to your will and your demands. A
      slave, a slave then! [Rises impetuously.] No, I cannot endure the thought
      of that! Never!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looks half-mockingly at her.] People generally get used to the
      inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Returns his look.] Yes, perhaps. [She crosses to the writing-table.
      Suppressing an involuntary smile, she imitates TESMAN'S intonations.]
      Well? Are you getting on, George? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven knows, dear. In any case it will be the work of months.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [As before.] Fancy that! [Passes her hands softly through Mrs. Elvsted's
      hair.] Doesn't it seem strange to you, Thea? Here are you sitting with
      Tesman&mdash;just as you used to sit with Eilert Lovborg?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, if I could only inspire your husband in the same way!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that will come too&mdash;in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, do you know, Hedda&mdash;I really think I begin to feel something of
      the sort. But won't you go and sit with Brack again?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there nothing I can do to help you two?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, nothing in the world. [Turning his head.] I trust to you to keep Hedda
      company, my dear Brack.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With a glance at HEDDA.] With the very greatest of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks. But I am tired this evening. I will go in and lie down a little on
      the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, do dear&mdash;eh?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [HEDDA goes into the back room and draws the curtains.  A short
       pause.  Suddenly she is heard playing a wild dance on the piano.
</pre>
    <p>
      MRS. ELVSTED.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Starts from her chair.] Oh&mdash;what is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Runs to the doorway.] Why, my dearest Hedda&mdash;don't play dance-music
      to-night! Just think of Aunt Rina! And of Eilert too!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Puts her head out between the curtains.] And of Aunt Julia. And of all
      the rest of them.&mdash;After this, I will be quiet. [Closes the curtains
      again.]
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [At the writing-table.] It's not good for her to see us at this
      distressing work. I'll tell you what, Mrs. Elvsted,&mdash;you shall take
      the empty room at Aunt Julia's, and then I will come over in the evenings,
      and we can sit and work there&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In the inner room.] I hear what you are saying, Tesman. But how am <i>I</i>
      to get through the evenings out here?
    </p>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Turning over the papers.] Oh, I daresay Judge Brack will be so kind as to
      look in now and then, even though I am out.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [In the arm-chair, calls out gaily.] Every blessed evening, with all the
      pleasure in life, Mrs. Tesman! We shall get on capitally together, we two!
    </p>
    <p>
      HEDDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Speaking loud and clear.] Yes, don't you flatter yourself we will, Judge
      Brack? Now that you are the one cock in the basket&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [A shot is heard within.  TESMAN, MRS. ELVSTED, and BRACK leap
       to their feet.
</pre>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, now she is playing with those pistols again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [He throws back the curtains and runs in, followed by MRS.
       ELVSTED.  HEDDA lies stretched on the sofa, lifeless.
       Confusion and cries.  BERTA enters in alarm from the right.
</pre>
    <p>
      TESMAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shrieks to BRACK.] Shot herself! Shot herself in the temple! Fancy that!
    </p>
    <p>
      BRACK.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Half-fainting in the arm-chair.] Good God!&mdash;people don't do such
      things.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
